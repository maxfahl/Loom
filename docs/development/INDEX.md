- **Story Location Change:** Stories moved from `docs/stories/` to structured format:
  - `docs/development/features/epic-1-core-workspace-jump/epics/epic-1/stories/`
  - Old location (`docs/stories/`) is deprecated but contains same content
- Story files include both Markdown (`.md`) and Story Context XML (`-context.xml`)
