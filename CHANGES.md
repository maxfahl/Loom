# Changes Made: Adding senior-developer Agent

## Date
2025-10-22

## Summary
Added the critical missing **senior-developer** agent to the meta prompt framework. This agent serves as the primary general implementation agent for the TDD green phase (writing code to pass tests).

## Problem Identified
The meta prompt framework had 12 agents including specialized agents (React component builder, refactor specialist) but lacked a general senior developer agent for implementing features. This was identified as a "major flaw" because there was no primary implementation agent for the `/dev` command.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added senior-developer Agent Definition
**Location**: Line 3240-3287 in `project-setup-meta-prompt.md`

**Content**:
- Agent positioned as #2 (between coordinator and test-writer)
- Model: Sonnet 4.5
- Tools: Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob, Bash
- Responsibilities: General feature implementation following TDD methodology
- MCP Integration: Optional github integration for search_code
- Parallel spawning: Can spawn multiple instances (backend + frontend)
- TDD variations: Supports fully enforced, recommended, or no TDD enforcement

### 2. Renumbered All Subsequent Agents
**Method**: Used sed command to batch renumber

**Changes**:
- test-writer: 2 → 3
- documentation-writer: 3 → 4
- bug-finder: 4 → 5
- refactor-specialist: 5 → 6
- qa-tester: 6 → 7
- git-helper: 7 → 8
- architecture-advisor: 8 → 9
- performance-optimizer: 9 → 10
- agent-creator: 10 → 11
- skill-creator: 11 → 12

### 3. Updated Agent Counts Throughout Document
**Changes**: 12 → 13

**Locations**:
- Line 31: MCP integration count (11/13 agents)
- Line 75: Phase 3 checklist
- Line 80-81: Template mode checklist
- Line 110: CLAUDE.md section
- Line 473: Validation agent instructions
- Line 736: Update mode principles
- Line 2416: Core agents section header
- Line 5119: Phase 3 header
- Line 5347: Final checklist

### 4. Added senior-developer to MCP Integration Section
**Location**: Line 3607-3612

**Content**:
```markdown
**senior-developer**:

- MCP: github (optional)
- Tools: search_code
- Usage: Search for similar implementations in codebase to maintain consistency
- Note: Optional - only use when checking existing patterns before implementing new features
```

### 5. Updated Coordinator Workflow References
**Locations**: Lines 2593-2616, 3800-3802, 3850-3886, 4430-4435

**Changes**:
- Step 3.3 (TDD Green Phase): Now explicitly spawns senior-developer agent(s)
- Added note about parallel spawning for full-stack features
- Updated all workflow examples to use senior-developer instead of generic "implementation agent"
- Updated parallelization patterns (Patterns 1, 2, 3) to reference senior-developer

### 6. Created Migration Guide for Existing Projects
**File**: `add-senior-developer-to-existing-project.md` (13KB)

**Contents**:
- Complete agent file template with all sections
- Step-by-step instructions to update CLAUDE.md
- Instructions to update /dev and /review commands
- Instructions to update coordinator agent
- Instructions to update INDEX.md
- Verification checklist
- Common issues and fixes
- Testing instructions

## Files Modified

1. **project-setup-meta-prompt.md** (156KB)
   - Added senior-developer agent definition
   - Renumbered agents 3-12
   - Updated all agent counts
   - Updated MCP integration section
   - Updated coordinator workflow examples

2. **add-senior-developer-to-existing-project.md** (13KB) - NEW
   - Complete migration guide for existing projects
   - Ready to copy-paste into any existing project

3. **CHANGES.md** (this file) - NEW
   - Documentation of all changes made

## Verification

### References Count
- 21 total references to "senior-developer" in meta prompt
- References distributed across:
  - Agent definition section
  - MCP integration section
  - Coordinator workflow (TDD green phase)
  - Parallelization examples
  - Usage examples

### Agent Count Updates
All instances of "12" updated to "13" in relevant contexts:
- ✅ MCP integration count
- ✅ Phase 3 checklists
- ✅ CLAUDE.md instructions
- ✅ Validation instructions
- ✅ Core agents section

### Workflow Integration
senior-developer now referenced in:
- ✅ TDD Green Phase (Step 3.3)
- ✅ Coordinator delegation examples
- ✅ Parallelization Pattern 1 (Full-Stack Feature)
- ✅ Parallelization Pattern 2 (Review + New Work)
- ✅ Parallelization Pattern 3 (Multi-Component Development)
- ✅ "Implement user auth" example

## Impact

### For New Projects
- Meta prompt now instructs Claude Code to create senior-developer agent automatically
- /dev command will use senior-developer for implementation
- Coordinator will spawn senior-developer during TDD green phase
- Framework now has complete agent coverage: coordinator → senior-developer → test-writer

### For Existing Projects
- Migration guide provides complete instructions
- Can add senior-developer in <10 minutes following guide
- All necessary documentation updates documented
- Testing and verification steps included

## Key Features of senior-developer Agent

1. **Primary Implementation Agent**: Used in /dev command for TDD green phase
2. **Parallel Capable**: Can spawn multiple instances (backend, frontend, etc.)
3. **MCP Enabled**: Optional github integration for searching similar code
4. **TDD Focused**: Writes minimal code to pass tests
5. **Architecture Compliant**: Follows project patterns and standards
6. **Context Aware**: Reads INDEX.md and status.xml before implementing

## Positioning in Agent Hierarchy

```
1. coordinator (orchestrates)
   ↓
2. senior-developer (implements) ← NEW
   ↓
3. test-writer (tests)
   ↓
4-13. specialized agents (review, refactor, docs, etc.)
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test the meta prompt**: Use it to set up a new project and verify senior-developer is created
2. **Test the migration guide**: Use it on an existing project to add senior-developer
3. **Gather feedback**: See if senior-developer fulfills its role as primary implementation agent
4. **Iterate**: Adjust agent responsibilities if needed based on real-world usage

## Notes

- All changes maintain backward compatibility with existing project structure
- Migration guide is non-destructive (only adds, doesn't remove)
- Agent numbering is consistent throughout document
- MCP integration is optional (agent works without it)
