description: Validate epic completion against checkpoint criteria
---

You are now in **CHECKPOINT VALIDATION MODE** for Jump workspace manager. Let's verify epic quality! ‚úÖ

## What Are Checkpoints?

Epic checkpoints are **quality gates** that must pass before moving to the next epic. They ensure:

- All stories complete and working
- Performance targets met
- Test coverage adequate
- User experience validated
- No critical bugs

## Checkpoint Criteria Source

All criteria defined in: `docs/development/TESTING_STRATEGY.md`

### Epic 1: Core Workspace Jump ‚úÖ VALIDATED

- [x] All 10 stories complete
- [x] 148 E2E tests passing
- [x] Jump latency < 100ms
- [x] Popover renders < 50ms
- [x] No force unwraps in codebase

### Epic 2: State Persistence üìã PENDING

- [ ] Workspace persistence reliable
- [ ] Load time < 100ms
- [ ] Data integrity validated
- [ ] Migration tested
- [ ] Corruption handling works

### Epic 3-5: Not yet started

## What I'll Do

When you run `/checkpoint epic-X`, I will:

1. **Load Checkpoint Criteria**
   - Read from TESTING_STRATEGY.md
   - Identify all criteria for epic
   - Categorize by type (functional, performance, quality)

2. **Run Validation Suite**
   - Execute all tests (unit + E2E)
   - Measure performance metrics
   - Check code quality
   - Validate user flows

3. **Measure Each Criterion**
   - Functional: Do all features work?
   - Performance: Meet latency targets?
   - Quality: Test coverage > 80%?
   - Reliability: No crashes in 8-hour test?

4. **Generate Report**
   - ‚úÖ Criteria met
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Criteria partially met (with gaps)
   - ‚ùå Criteria not met (blockers)
   - Overall: PASS or FAIL

5. **Provide Recommendation**
   - APPROVED: Epic complete, move to next
   - CONDITIONAL: Minor fixes needed
   - BLOCKED: Critical issues must be resolved

## Validation Categories

### 1. Functional Validation

Verify all stories work correctly:

```
‚úÖ story-2.1: Persist workspaces to JSON - WORKING
‚úÖ story-2.2: Load workspaces on launch - WORKING
‚úÖ story-2.3: Handle workspace updates - WORKING
...
```

### 2. Performance Validation

Measure against targets:

```
Target: Load workspaces < 100ms
Measured: 47ms avg (100 trials)
Result: ‚úÖ PASS (53ms margin)

Target: Save workspace < 50ms
Measured: 23ms avg (100 trials)
Result: ‚úÖ PASS (27ms margin)
```

### 3. Quality Validation

```

### 4. Reliability Validation

Long-running stability tests:

```
8-Hour Crash-Free Test: ‚úÖ PASS
Memory Leaks: None detected
Race Conditions: None detected
Battery Impact: 2.1%/hour (target: <3%)
```

### 5. User Experience Validation

‚ö†Ô∏è PERFORMANCE GAP:

Criterion: Workspace load < 100ms
Measured: 127ms avg (100 trials)
Result: ‚ùå FAIL (27ms over target)

Root Cause: JSON parsing is slower than expected
Suggested Fix:
1. Profile with Instruments to find bottleneck
2. Consider lazy loading of workspace details
3. Optimize Codable implementation

Impact: Minor (UX slightly slower, but usable)
Blocking: No (within acceptable range)

Epic 2 is CONDITIONALLY APPROVED ‚ö†Ô∏è

Options:
A. Proceed to Epic 3 and address performance in Epic 5
B. Fix performance issue now before proceeding
C. Create tech debt story for later optimization

My recommendation: Option A
- Issue is minor (27ms over target)
- App is still very usable
- Can optimize in Epic 5 (Performance & Reliability)
- Doesn't block user value delivery

Your decision? (A/B/C)

Epic 2 is BLOCKED ‚ùå

Must fix all critical issues before proceeding:
1. Complete story-2.9 and story-2.10
2. Add tests to reach 80%+ coverage
3. Fix crash in long-running test

DO NOT PROCEED TO EPIC 3 until these are resolved.

Estimated time to unblock: 14-22 hours

Would you like me to:
1. Start on story-2.9? (/dev story-2.9)
2. Add missing tests? (/test --add-coverage)
3. Debug crash? (/debug crash-report.txt)
```

## Checkpoint Options

```bash
/checkpoint epic-X              # Validate epic X
/checkpoint epic-X --quick      # Quick validation (skip long tests)
/checkpoint epic-X --report     # Generate detailed PDF report
/checkpoint epic-X --fix        # Auto-fix minor issues

## Manual Validation Checklist

For each epic, I'll provide a manual testing checklist:

```markdown
# Epic 2 Manual Validation Checklist

## Workspace Persistence

- [ ] Create workspace and restart app ‚Üí workspace still exists
- [ ] Modify workspace and restart ‚Üí changes persisted
- [ ] Delete workspace and restart ‚Üí workspace gone

## Error Handling

- [ ] Corrupt JSON file ‚Üí app starts with empty state + notification
- [ ] Delete JSON file ‚Üí app starts with empty state (no crash)
- [ ] Invalid permissions ‚Üí graceful error message

## Performance

- [ ] App launches in < 2 seconds
- [ ] Workspace list appears in < 100ms
- [ ] Saving workspace feels instant (< 50ms)

## Edge Cases
