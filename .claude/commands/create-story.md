description: Create the next user story for the current epic
model: claude-sonnet-4-5
---

**Purpose**: Analyze completed work, identify next story, and create comprehensive story file

**Process**:

1. Read status.xml to identify active feature and current epic
2. Read epic TASKS.md in `docs/development/features/[feature-name]/epics/[current-epic]/`
3. Check existing stories in `docs/development/features/[feature-name]/epics/[current-epic]/stories/` to see what's been created
4. Analyze what's been completed vs what's pending in the epic
5. Determine next story number (e.g., if current-story is 2.1, check if 2.1 exists, create 2.2)
6. **CRITICAL**: Create new story file at `docs/development/features/[feature-name]/epics/[current-epic]/stories/[epic.story].md`
   - NOT in `features/[feature-name]/`
   - NOT in `docs/development/features/[feature-name]/stories/`
   - ONLY in `docs/development/features/[feature-name]/epics/[current-epic]/stories/`
7. Update status.xml `<current-story>` to the new story number
8. Update `<last-updated>` timestamp

**Story File Location** (CRITICAL - DO NOT CHANGE):
- **Correct**: `docs/development/features/[feature-name]/epics/[epic-name]/stories/X.Y.md`
- **Wrong**: `features/[feature-name]/stories/X.Y.md`
- **Wrong**: `docs/development/features/[feature-name]/stories/X.Y.md`
