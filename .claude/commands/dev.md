# /dev - Continue Development

## What This Command Does

Resume development following configured autonomy level. Behavior adapts based on `/yolo` settings.

## Process

**Step 0: Read YOLO Configuration**:

- Read `docs/development/status.xml` for active feature
- Check `<autonomy-level>` (manual/balanced/story/epic/custom)
- Read breakpoint configuration
- Determine execution mode based on autonomy level

**Step 1: Read Current Context**:

- Read `<current-story>` value (e.g., "1.2")
- Read story file at `docs/development/features/[feature]/epics/[epic]/stories/[current-story].md`

**Step 2: Determine Execution Mode**:

- **MANUAL Mode**: Interactive work, stop at all breakpoints (A, B, C, D)
- **BALANCED Mode**: Semi-autonomous, stop at B (before commit) and C (between stories)
- **STORY Mode**: Spawn coordinator agent to complete entire story, stop at C
- **EPIC Mode**: Spawn coordinator agent to complete entire epic, stop at D
- **CUSTOM Mode**: Follow user-defined stopping conditions

**Step 3: Execute Based on Mode**:

_For MANUAL Mode (Fully Interactive)_:

1. Check for Review Tasks FIRST (priority: Fix > Improvement > Nit)
2. If review tasks exist, work on those before regular tasks
3. Work on Regular Tasks from "## Tasks and Subtasks"
4. Check off subtasks as completed (`[ ]` ‚Üí `[x]`)
5. Update story status to "Waiting For Review" when all tasks done
6. Follow TDD: üî¥ RED ‚Üí üü¢ GREEN ‚Üí üîµ REFACTOR ‚Üí ‚úÖ REVIEW ‚Üí üìä TEST ‚Üí üìù COMMIT
7. Stop at all breakpoints (A, B, C, D)

_For BALANCED Mode (Semi-Autonomous)_:

1. Check for Review Tasks FIRST (priority: Fix > Improvement > Nit)
2. Work through tasks interactively with user guidance
3. Check off subtasks as completed (`[ ]` ‚Üí `[x]`)
4. Update story status to "Waiting For Review" when all tasks done
5. Follow TDD: üî¥ RED ‚Üí üü¢ GREEN ‚Üí üîµ REFACTOR ‚Üí ‚úÖ REVIEW ‚Üí üìä TEST ‚Üí üìù COMMIT
6. Stop at breakpoints B (before commit) and C (between stories)

_For STORY/EPIC/CUSTOM Modes (Autonomous)_:

- **Spawn coordinator agent** using Task tool
- Coordinator executes **9-phase autonomous workflow**:
  - **Phase 0**: Initialization - Read project state, analyze story readiness
  - **Phase 1**: Pre-Development - Research, docs, architecture (parallel)
  - **Phase 2**: TDD Red - Write failing tests (parallel by type: unit/integration/E2E)
  - **Phase 3**: TDD Green - Implement code (parallel by layer: frontend/backend/mobile)
  - **Phase 4**: TDD Refactor - Clean up code while tests stay green
  - **Phase 5**: Review - Run all reviews in parallel (code/security/design)
  - **Phase 6**: Review Loop - Fix issues if found, loop until "Done"
  - **Phase 7**: Final Verification - Tests, coverage, documentation
  - **Phase 8**: Commit - Conventional commits (if breakpoint B allows)
  - **Phase 9**: Story Loop - Continue to next story/epic (if breakpoints allow)
- Coordinator **maximizes parallelization** (60-80% time savings)
- Coordinator **updates story file** after each phase
- Coordinator **stops at configured breakpoints**

**TDD Variations**:

- **Fully Enforced**: "Follow TDD Red-Green-Refactor strictly. Write failing test FIRST, then implement."
- **Recommended**: "Follow TDD Red-Green-Refactor when possible. Consider writing tests first."
- **No TDD**: "Continue implementation. Add tests for critical functionality."

## Agent Delegation

**For MANUAL mode** (Interactive Development):

```markdown
# Direct execution - No coordinator agent spawned
# Work interactively with user on current story
# Stop at all breakpoints (A, B, C, D)
# User maintains full control over each step
```

**For BALANCED mode** (Semi-Autonomous):

```markdown
# Direct execution - No coordinator agent spawned initially
# Work semi-autonomously on story tasks
# Stop at breakpoints B (before commit) and C (between stories)
# Balance between autonomy and user control
```

**For STORY mode** (Complete Single Story):

```markdown
Use the Task tool to spawn coordinator agent:

Task(
  subagent_type="coordinator",
  description="Complete story [X.Y] with TDD",
  prompt="Execute development workflow for Story [X.Y].

  YOLO Mode: STORY
  Breakpoint A (before research): DISABLED - Work through research
  Breakpoint B (before commit): DISABLED - Auto-commit when ready
  Breakpoint C (between stories): ENABLED - STOP after this story
  Breakpoint D (between epics): N/A - Will stop at C first

  Instructions:
  1. Execute complete 9-phase TDD workflow for this story
  2. Work autonomously through all phases
  3. Auto-commit when appropriate
  4. STOP and report back after story completion
  5. Do NOT continue to next story - wait for user"
)
```

**For EPIC mode** (CRITICAL - Must enable auto-continuation):

```markdown
Use the Task tool to spawn coordinator agent:

Task(
  subagent_type="coordinator",
  description="Complete entire epic autonomously",
  prompt="CRITICAL: You are in EPIC MODE with continuous execution.

  Current Epic: [epic number and name]
  Starting Story: [X.Y]
  YOLO Mode: EPIC
  Breakpoint C (between stories): DISABLED - DO NOT STOP
  Breakpoint D (between epics): [enabled/disabled from status.xml]

  CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR EPIC MODE:
  1. Execute complete 9-phase workflow for current story
  2. After completing each story, check if more stories exist in epic
  3. If more stories exist: IMMEDIATELY spawn another coordinator for next story
  4. DO NOT return control between stories
  5. DO NOT ask for user confirmation
  6. Continue autonomously until entire epic is complete
  7. Only stop at epic boundary if Breakpoint D is enabled

  Remember: You MUST self-spawn for the next story. This is EPIC mode - full autonomy within the epic."
)
```

**For CUSTOM mode**:

```markdown
Use the Task tool to spawn coordinator agent:

Task(
  subagent_type="coordinator",
  description="Execute custom autonomy workflow",
  prompt="Execute development workflow with custom autonomy settings.

  Custom Breakpoints:
  - A (before research): [enabled/disabled]
  - B (before commit): [enabled/disabled]
  - C (between stories): [enabled/disabled]
  - D (between epics): [enabled/disabled]

  Follow the specific breakpoint configuration and continue/stop accordingly.
  If C is disabled and in an epic, self-spawn for next story."
)
```

## Recommended Skills

<!-- TODO: Add relevant skills from .claude/skills/ -->

- `tdd-red-green-refactor` - For test-driven development
- `atomic-commits` - For commit best practices
- `clean-code-principles` - For code quality

Use these skills heavily throughout execution to ensure best practices.

**Skill Troubleshooting Authority**: If any referenced skill does not work or any script within the skill does not work, Claude Code has the authority to fix them.

## Arguments

This command takes no arguments. Behavior is determined by YOLO configuration in status.xml.

## Examples

```
/dev
```

Reads status.xml, determines mode, and continues development accordingly.
