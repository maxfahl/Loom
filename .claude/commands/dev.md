# /dev - Continue Development

## What This Command Does

Resume development following configured autonomy level. Behavior adapts based on `/yolo` settings.

## Process

**Step 0: Read YOLO Configuration**:

- Read `docs/development/status.xml` for active feature
- Check `<autonomy-level>` (manual/balanced/story/epic/custom)
- Read breakpoint configuration
- Determine execution mode based on autonomy level

**Step 1: Read Current Context**:

- Read `<current-story>` value (e.g., "1.2")
- Read story file at `docs/development/features/[feature]/epics/[epic]/stories/[current-story].md`

**Step 2: Determine Execution Mode**:

- **MANUAL Mode**: Interactive work, stop at all breakpoints (A, B, C, D)
- **BALANCED Mode**: Semi-autonomous, stop at B (before commit) and C (between stories)
- **STORY Mode**: Spawn coordinator agent to complete entire story, stop at C
- **EPIC Mode**: Spawn coordinator agent to complete entire epic, stop at D
- **CUSTOM Mode**: Follow user-defined stopping conditions

**Step 3: Execute Based on Mode**:

_For MANUAL Mode (Fully Interactive)_:

1. Check for Review Tasks FIRST (priority: Fix > Improvement > Nit)
2. If review tasks exist, work on those before regular tasks
3. Work on Regular Tasks from "## Tasks and Subtasks"
4. Check off subtasks as completed (`[ ]` ‚Üí `[x]`)
5. Update story status to "Waiting For Review" when all tasks done
6. Follow TDD: üî¥ RED ‚Üí üü¢ GREEN ‚Üí üîµ REFACTOR ‚Üí ‚úÖ REVIEW ‚Üí üìä TEST ‚Üí üìù COMMIT
7. Stop at all breakpoints (A, B, C, D)

_For BALANCED Mode (Semi-Autonomous)_:

1. Check for Review Tasks FIRST (priority: Fix > Improvement > Nit)
2. Work through tasks interactively with user guidance
3. Check off subtasks as completed (`[ ]` ‚Üí `[x]`)
4. Update story status to "Waiting For Review" when all tasks done
5. Follow TDD: üî¥ RED ‚Üí üü¢ GREEN ‚Üí üîµ REFACTOR ‚Üí ‚úÖ REVIEW ‚Üí üìä TEST ‚Üí üìù COMMIT
6. Stop at breakpoints B (before commit) and C (between stories)

_For STORY/EPIC/CUSTOM Modes (Autonomous)_:

- **Spawn coordinator agent** using Task tool
- Coordinator executes **9-phase autonomous workflow**:
  - **Phase 0**: Initialization - Read project state, analyze story readiness
  - **Phase 1**: Pre-Development - Research, docs, architecture (parallel)
  - **Phase 2**: TDD Red - Write failing tests (parallel by type: unit/integration/E2E)
  - **Phase 3**: TDD Green - Implement code (parallel by layer: frontend/backend/mobile)
  - **Phase 4**: TDD Refactor - Clean up code while tests stay green
  - **Phase 5**: Review - Run all reviews in parallel (code/security/design)
  - **Phase 6**: Review Loop - Fix issues if found, loop until "Done"
  - **Phase 7**: Final Verification - Tests, coverage, documentation
  - **Phase 8**: Commit - Conventional commits (if breakpoint B allows)
  - **Phase 9**: Story Loop - Continue to next story/epic (if breakpoints allow)
- Coordinator **maximizes parallelization** (60-80% time savings)
- Coordinator **updates story file** after each phase
- Coordinator **stops at configured breakpoints**

**TDD Variations**:

- **Fully Enforced**: "Follow TDD Red-Green-Refactor strictly. Write failing test FIRST, then implement."
- **Recommended**: "Follow TDD Red-Green-Refactor when possible. Consider writing tests first."
- **No TDD**: "Continue implementation. Add tests for critical functionality."

## Agent Delegation

**For STORY/EPIC/CUSTOM modes**:

```markdown
Use the Task tool to spawn coordinator agent:

Task(
subagent_type="coordinator",
description="Complete [story/epic] following TDD and YOLO configuration",
prompt="Execute development workflow for [story/epic details]. Follow configured autonomy level and stop at enabled breakpoints. Execute complete TDD cycle with parallel sub-agents."
)
```

## Recommended Skills

<!-- TODO: Add relevant skills from .claude/skills/ -->

- `tdd-red-green-refactor` - For test-driven development
- `atomic-commits` - For commit best practices
- `clean-code-principles` - For code quality

Use these skills heavily throughout execution to ensure best practices.

**Skill Troubleshooting Authority**: If any referenced skill does not work or any script within the skill does not work, Claude Code has the authority to fix them.

## Arguments

This command takes no arguments. Behavior is determined by YOLO configuration in status.xml.

## Examples

```
/dev
```

Reads status.xml, determines mode, and continues development accordingly.
