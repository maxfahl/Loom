# Python (Django/Flask) Development Skill

This skill provides comprehensive guidance and automation tools for developing web applications and APIs using Python with the Django and Flask frameworks.

## Overview

It covers best practices for:
- Project structure and modularity
- Efficient ORM usage (Django ORM, SQLAlchemy)
- Designing and implementing robust APIs (Django REST Framework, Flask-RESTful/RESTX)
- Thorough testing strategies (unit, integration, E2E)
- Secure deployment and configuration
- Adhering to security best practices (OWASP Top 10)
- Maintaining code quality (PEP 8, type hinting)

## Key Features

- **Best Practices:** Recommendations for building scalable, maintainable, and secure Python web applications.
- **Anti-Patterns:** Identification of common pitfalls and how to avoid them.
- **Code Review Checklist:** A structured list of items to verify during code reviews.
- **Automation Scripts:** A set of utility scripts to streamline common development tasks.

## Automation Scripts

This skill includes the following automation scripts in the `scripts/` directory:

1.  `project-initializer.py`: Interactively scaffolds a new Django or Flask project with a best-practice structure.
2.  `db-migration-helper.sh`: Simplifies database migration workflows for both Django and Flask.
3.  `api-crud-generator.py`: Generates boilerplate code for new CRUD API endpoints.
4.  `dependency-auditor.sh`: Automates checking for outdated and vulnerable dependencies.
