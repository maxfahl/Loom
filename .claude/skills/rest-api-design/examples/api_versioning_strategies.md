# api_versioning_strategies.md

This document outlines common strategies for API versioning in RESTful API design.
API versioning is crucial for managing changes to your API without breaking existing client integrations.

## Why Version APIs?

-   **Backward Compatibility**: Allows you to introduce breaking changes (e.g., removing fields, changing data types, altering endpoint paths) without forcing all clients to update immediately.
-   **Client Stability**: Ensures that existing clients continue to function as expected while new features are rolled out.
-   **Evolution**: Facilitates the evolution of your API over time to meet new requirements or improve design.

## Common API Versioning Strategies

### 1. URI Versioning (Path Versioning)

-   **Description**: The API version is included directly in the URI path.
-   **Example**: `https://api.example.com/v1/users`
-   **Pros**:
    -   **Simple and Explicit**: Very clear to clients which version they are using.
    -   **Easy to Cache**: Different versions have distinct URIs, simplifying caching.
    -   **Browser Friendly**: Easy to test in a browser.
-   **Cons**:
    -   **Violates REST Principle**: The URI should identify a resource, not its representation or version. A resource conceptually remains the same across versions.
    -   **URI Pollution**: The version number is part of every URI.
    -   **Routing Complexity**: Can lead to more complex routing configurations on the server.
-   **Recommendation**: Most common and often preferred for its simplicity and clarity, despite the REST purist argument.

### 2. Custom Header Versioning

-   **Description**: The API version is specified in a custom HTTP request header.
-   **Example**: `X-API-Version: 1` or `X-Version: 1`
-   **Pros**:
    -   **Clean URIs**: Keeps the URI path clean and focused on the resource.
    -   **RESTful**: More aligned with REST principles as the URI identifies the resource, and the header specifies the desired representation.
-   **Cons**:
    -   **Less Discoverable**: Not immediately obvious from the URI.
    -   **Browser Testing**: Harder to test directly in a browser.
    -   **Proxy/CDN Issues**: Some proxies or CDNs might strip custom headers.
-   **Recommendation**: A good alternative for cleaner URIs, but requires clients to manage headers.

### 3. Accept Header Versioning (Content Negotiation)

-   **Description**: The API version is specified in the `Accept` HTTP header, often using a custom media type.
-   **Example**: `Accept: application/vnd.example.v1+json`
-   **Pros**:
    -   **Highly RESTful**: Leverages standard HTTP content negotiation.
    -   **Clean URIs**: Keeps the URI path clean.
    -   **Flexibility**: Can specify both version and format (e.g., `v1+json`, `v2+xml`).
-   **Cons**:
    -   **Complex for Clients**: Requires clients to construct specific `Accept` headers.
    -   **Less Discoverable**: Not immediately obvious.
    -   **Browser Testing**: Very difficult to test directly in a browser.
    -   **Tooling Support**: Some tools might have limited support for custom media types.
-   **Recommendation**: While technically most RESTful, its complexity often makes it less practical for public APIs compared to URI versioning.

### 4. Query Parameter Versioning

-   **Description**: The API version is included as a query parameter in the URI.
-   **Example**: `https://api.example.com/users?version=1`
-   **Pros**:
    -   **Easy to Implement**: Simple to add to existing endpoints.
    -   **Browser Friendly**: Easy to test in a browser.
-   **Cons**:
    -   **Least RESTful**: Query parameters are typically for filtering or sorting resources, not identifying their version.
    -   **Caching Issues**: Can lead to caching problems if not handled carefully, as `?version=1` and `?version=2` might refer to the same logical resource.
    -   **URI Pollution**: Adds unnecessary parameters to the URI.
-   **Recommendation**: Generally discouraged due to its less RESTful nature and potential caching issues.

## Best Practices for API Versioning

-   **Version from Day One**: Even if you don't anticipate immediate changes, include versioning in your initial API design.
-   **Be Consistent**: Choose one strategy and apply it uniformly across your entire API.
-   **Communicate Changes Clearly**: Document all API versions and their changes thoroughly.
-   **Support Older Versions (for a period)**: Provide a deprecation policy and support older versions for a reasonable transition period.
-   **Avoid Micro-Versioning**: Don't version for every minor change. Only introduce a new version for breaking changes.
-   **Default to Latest Version**: If no version is specified by the client, default to the latest stable version.

## Decision Tree for Versioning Strategy

1.  **Is simplicity and discoverability paramount?**
    -   ✅ **URI Versioning** (e.g., `/v1/users`)
2.  **Do you prioritize clean URIs and REST purity, and are clients capable of managing custom headers?**
    -   ✅ **Custom Header Versioning** (e.g., `X-API-Version: 1`)
3.  **Is your API highly public, and do you need maximum RESTfulness with content negotiation?**
    -   ✅ **Accept Header Versioning** (e.g., `Accept: application/vnd.example.v1+json`)
4.  **Do you need a quick, temporary solution for internal APIs, accepting its less RESTful nature?**
    -   ❌ **Query Parameter Versioning** (Generally discouraged)
