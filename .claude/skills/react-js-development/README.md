## Automation Scripts

This package includes the following utility scripts:

- `generate-component.sh`: Quickly scaffolds a new React functional component with TypeScript, including a basic test file and CSS module.
- `find-unused-exports.py`: Analyzes the project to identify potentially unused exported React components or functions.
