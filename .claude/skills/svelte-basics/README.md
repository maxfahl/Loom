# Svelte Basics Skill

This skill provides comprehensive guidance and tools for building web applications with Svelte and SvelteKit, focusing on core concepts, best practices, and efficient development workflows.

## Overview

Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Rather than using techniques like virtual DOM diffing, Svelte compiles your code into tiny, vanilla JavaScript bundles at build time. This skill helps developers and AI agents harness Svelte's power by:

- **Mastering core concepts:** Covering reactivity, components, and lifecycle hooks.
- **Leveraging SvelteKit:** Guiding on file-based routing, data loading, and API routes for full-stack development.
- **Implementing state management:** Focusing on Svelte's built-in stores and their effective use.
- **Ensuring type safety:** Integrating TypeScript for robust and maintainable code.
- **Streamlining development:** Providing automation scripts for common, repetitive tasks.

## Key Features

- **Detailed `SKILL.md`:** A comprehensive guide covering core concepts, best practices, common pitfalls, and a code review checklist.
- **Practical Examples:** A collection of TypeScript-first code examples demonstrating various aspects of Svelte and SvelteKit, including components, stores, and routes.
- **Automation Scripts:** A set of scripts designed to automate repetitive tasks, such as generating components, scaffolding stores, and assisting with Svelte 5 Runes migration.

## Directory Structure
