# Risk Matrix (Likelihood vs. Impact)

A Risk Matrix is a tool used for assessing and prioritizing risks by combining the likelihood of a risk occurring with the severity of its impact.

## How to Use:

1.  **Assess Likelihood:** Determine how probable it is that the risk will occur.
2.  **Assess Impact:** Determine the severity of the consequences if the risk does occur.
3.  **Locate in Matrix:** Find the intersection of the assessed Likelihood and Impact to determine the risk's priority level.

## Likelihood Definitions:

-   **High (3):** Very likely to occur; expected to happen frequently or almost certainly.
-   **Medium (2):** Moderately likely to occur; might happen occasionally.
-   **Low (1):** Unlikely to occur; could happen but not expected.

## Impact Definitions:

-   **High (3):** Severe consequences; significant financial loss, major project delay, critical system failure, legal/reputational damage.
-   **Medium (2):** Moderate consequences; noticeable financial loss, minor project delay, degraded system performance, some reputational damage.
-   **Low (1):** Minor consequences; negligible financial loss, minimal project impact, minor inconvenience.

## Risk Priority Matrix:

| Likelihood \ Impact | Low (1) | Medium (2) | High (3) |
| :------------------ | :------ | :--------- | :------- |
| **High (3)**        | Medium  | High       | Critical |
| **Medium (2)**      | Low     | Medium     | High     |
| **Low (1)**         | Low     | Low        | Medium   |

## Priority Levels:

-   **Critical (9):** Immediate action required. Top priority for mitigation.
-   **High (6):** Urgent action required. Significant attention needed.
-   **Medium (3-4):** Action recommended. Monitor closely.
-   **Low (1-2):** Action optional. Monitor periodically.

## Example:

-   **Risk:** Critical security vulnerability in core dependency.
-   **Likelihood:** High (known vulnerability, public exploit available).
-   **Impact:** High (data breach, system compromise).
-   **Priority:** Critical (High x High).

-   **Risk:** Minor UI bug on a non-critical page.
-   **Likelihood:** Low (rarely encountered).
-   **Impact:** Low (minor inconvenience).
-   **Priority:** Low (Low x Low).
