# Security Checklist for New Features / Releases

This checklist provides a high-level overview of security considerations for new features or major releases. It is not exhaustive but aims to cover common security best practices.

## General Security

- [ ] All user input is properly validated and sanitized on the server-side.
- [ ] Output encoding is applied to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Authentication mechanisms are robust (e.g., strong password policies, MFA support).
- [ ] Authorization checks are implemented at every access point (least privilege principle).
- [ ] Sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
- [ ] Session management is secure (e.g., secure cookies, proper session invalidation).
- [ ] Error messages do not reveal sensitive system information.
- [ ] Logging and monitoring are in place for security-relevant events.
- [ ] Dependencies have been scanned for known vulnerabilities (SCA).
- [ ] Secrets (API keys, credentials) are stored securely and not hardcoded.
- [ ] Rate limiting is implemented for critical endpoints (e.g., login, password reset).
- [ ] Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection is in place for state-changing requests.
- [ ] HTTP Security Headers are configured (e.g., CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options).

## Data Protection & Privacy

- [ ] Data retention policies are followed.
- [ ] Data access is logged and auditable.
- [ ] Compliance with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) is ensured.
- [ ] Data anonymization or pseudonymization is applied where appropriate.

## API Security

- [ ] API endpoints are protected by appropriate authentication and authorization.
- [ ] Input validation is performed for all API parameters.
- [ ] API rate limiting is implemented.
- [ ] Sensitive data is not exposed via API responses.
- [ ] API versioning is handled securely.

## Infrastructure & Deployment

- [ ] Infrastructure is configured with the principle of least privilege.
- [ ] Network segmentation is properly implemented.
- [ ] Firewalls and security groups are correctly configured.
- [ ] Regular security patches are applied to servers and software.
- [ ] Automated security scanning is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
- [ ] Disaster recovery and backup procedures are in place and tested.

## Code Review & Testing

- [ ] Security-focused code reviews have been conducted.
- [ ] Unit and integration tests cover security-critical paths.
- [ ] Penetration testing or vulnerability assessments have been performed (if applicable).
- [ ] Threat modeling has been conducted for critical components.

## Incident Response

- [ ] Incident response plan is in place and understood by the team.
- [ ] Contact information for security incidents is readily available.
