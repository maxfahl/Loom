## 3. Core Knowledge

Claude should be familiar with the following fundamental concepts, patterns, and APIs:

### Core UI/UX Principles
- **User-Centered Design (UCD):** Prioritizing user needs, behaviors, and pain points.
- **Clarity & Simplicity:** Intuitive, easy-to-understand interfaces free of clutter.
- **Consistency:** Uniformity in design elements (buttons, colors, typography, spacing) across the application.
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Guiding the user's eye to important elements through size, color, and placement.
- **Accessibility (A11y) & Inclusivity:** Designing for all users, including those with disabilities (WCAG standards, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, sufficient contrast).
- **Feedback:** Providing immediate and clear responses to user actions.
- **Responsiveness & Mobile-First:** Seamless experiences across devices and screen sizes.
- **Performance & Speed:** Optimized load times and efficient interfaces.
- **Affordance:** Design elements that suggest their function.
- **Fitts's Law:** Time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target.
- **Hick's Law:** Time to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices.
- **Gestalt Principles:** Principles of perception (e.g., proximity, similarity, closure, continuity).

### Modern UI/UX Trends (2025)
- **AI-Driven Personalization:** Dynamic adaptation of interfaces based on user behavior.
- **Immersive Experiences:** AR/VR/MR integration (e.g., WebXR).
- **Voice & Gesture-Based Interfaces (VUI):** Conversational UIs, touchless interactions.
- **Microinteractions & Purposeful Animations:** Subtle animations for feedback and delight.
- **Ethical & Sustainable UX:** Transparent data practices, reduced digital footprint.
- **Bold Minimalism:** Dynamic minimalism with radical whitespace, oversized typography.
- **Depth with Clarity (Post-Neumorphism):** Subtle tactile elements without sacrificing clarity.
- **Cross-Platform & Multi-Device:** Adaptable and consistent experiences across all devices.
- **Data-Driven Design:** Using analytics for informed design decisions.

### Technical Considerations for Developers
- **Semantic HTML:** Using appropriate HTML tags for meaning and accessibility.
- **CSS Best Practices:** Maintainable, scalable CSS (e.g., CSS-in-JS, utility-first CSS like Tailwind, BEM).
- **JavaScript for Interactions:** Efficient and accessible event handling, state management.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** Reusable UI components (React, Vue, Angular, Web Components).
- **Design Systems:** Implementing and utilizing shared component libraries and design tokens.
- **Performance Optimization:** Image optimization, lazy loading, code splitting, critical CSS.
- **Accessibility Tools:** Linters (ESLint A11y plugins), automated testing (Axe-core), manual testing.
- **Responsive Design Techniques:** Media queries, flexbox, grid, `viewport` meta tag.

## 4. Key Guidance for Claude

### Always Recommend (✅ best practices)
- ✅ **User Research & Testing:** Emphasize understanding the target audience through research and validating designs with user testing.
- ✅ **Accessibility First:** Design and develop with WCAG guidelines in mind from the outset. Use semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and ensure keyboard navigability and sufficient color contrast.
- ✅ **Consistency:** Advocate for the use of design systems, component libraries, and consistent naming conventions to ensure a unified user experience.
- ✅ **Clear Feedback:** Implement clear visual and interactive feedback for all user actions (e.g., loading states, success messages, error notifications).
- ✅ **Performance Optimization:** Prioritize fast loading times and smooth interactions. Suggest techniques like image compression, lazy loading, and efficient rendering.
- ✅ **Mobile-First & Responsiveness:** Always consider the mobile experience first and ensure designs adapt gracefully to all screen sizes.
- ✅ **Progressive Enhancement:** Build core functionality first, then add enhancements for richer experiences.
- ✅ **Ethical Design:** Promote transparency in data usage, provide clear privacy controls, and avoid dark patterns.
- ✅ **Meaningful Microinteractions:** Use subtle animations and transitions to guide users and enhance delight without distraction.

### Never Recommend (❌ anti-patterns)
- ❌ **Ignoring Accessibility:** Never create interfaces that are inaccessible to users with disabilities. Avoid relying solely on visual cues or mouse interactions.
- ❌ **Inconsistent Design:** Do not introduce new UI patterns, colors, or typography without justification or alignment with an existing design system.
- ❌ **Lack of Feedback:** Avoid silent failures or actions without clear user feedback. Users should always know the system's status.
- ❌ **Poor Performance:** Do not implement heavy, unoptimized assets or complex animations that degrade performance and user experience.
- ❌ **Desktop-Only Design:** Never assume users will only access the interface on a desktop. Always consider mobile and tablet experiences.
- ❌ **Dark Patterns:** Avoid deceptive UI patterns that trick users into doing things they might not intend (e.g., hidden costs, forced continuity).
- ❌ **Over-Animation:** Do not use excessive or distracting animations that hinder usability or cause motion sickness.
- ❌ **Ambiguous Call-to-Actions:** Avoid unclear or hidden calls-to-action that confuse users about what to do next.

### Common Questions & Responses (FAQ format)

**Q: How can I ensure my UI is accessible?**
A: Start with semantic HTML, use ARIA attributes where native HTML isn't sufficient, ensure sufficient color contrast (WCAG AA/AAA), provide keyboard navigation, and add descriptive alt text for images. Regularly test with accessibility tools and screen readers.

**Q: My UI feels inconsistent. How can I fix this?**
A: Implement a design system. Define clear guidelines for typography, color palettes, spacing, and component usage. Use a component library and enforce its usage across the project. Conduct regular UI audits.

**Q: How do I improve the performance of my frontend?**
A: Optimize images (compression, correct formats, lazy loading), minimize JavaScript bundle size (tree-shaking, code splitting), use efficient CSS (avoiding complex selectors, critical CSS), leverage browser caching, and optimize rendering paths.

**Q: What's the best way to handle user feedback in the UI?**
A: Provide immediate visual feedback for interactions (e.g., button states, loading spinners). Use toast notifications or banners for success/error messages. For complex operations, use progress indicators. Ensure error messages are clear, concise, and actionable.

**Q: How do I make my design responsive?**
A: Adopt a mobile-first approach. Use flexible layouts with Flexbox and CSS Grid. Implement media queries to adjust styles for different breakpoints. Use relative units (%, `em`, `rem`, `vw`, `vh`) instead of fixed pixels where appropriate.

## 5. Anti-Patterns to Flag

### ❌ Bad: Inaccessible Button
```typescript
// BAD: Not accessible, relies on visual cues, no semantic meaning
<div onClick={handleClick} style={{ cursor: 'pointer', padding: '10px', border: '1px solid blue' }}>
  Click Me
</div>
```

### ✅ Good: Accessible Button
```typescript
// GOOD: Semantic, keyboard navigable, accessible to screen readers
<button type="button" onClick={handleClick}>
  Click Me
</button>
```

### ❌ Bad: Hardcoded Styles & Inconsistency
```typescript
// BAD: Inconsistent styling, difficult to maintain
<p style={{ color: '#FF0000', fontSize: '14px' }}>Error message</p>
// ... elsewhere ...
<span style={{ color: 'red', 'font-size': '0.875rem' }}>Another error</span>
```

### ✅ Good: Consistent Styling with Design Tokens/Classes
```typescript
// GOOD: Consistent, maintainable, uses design system
// Using utility classes (e.g., Tailwind CSS)
<p className="text-error text-sm">Error message</p>

// Or using CSS-in-JS with theme tokens
const ErrorText = styled.p`
  color: ${({ theme }) => theme.colors.error};
  font-size: ${({ theme }) => theme.fontSizes.sm};
`;
<ErrorText>Error message</ErrorText>
```

### ❌ Bad: Lack of Loading Feedback
```typescript
// BAD: User doesn't know if action is processing
const handleSubmit = async () => {
  await saveData();
  // ... no visual feedback during saveData() ...
};
```

### ✅ Good: Clear Loading Feedback
```typescript
// GOOD: User is informed that action is in progress
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);

const handleSubmit = async () => {
  setIsLoading(true);
  try {
    await saveData();
    // Show success message
  } catch (error) {
    // Show error message
  } finally {
    setIsLoading(false);
  }
};

return (
  <button type="submit" disabled={isLoading}>
    {isLoading ? 'Saving...' : 'Save'}
  </button>
);
```
