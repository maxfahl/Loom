## Overview

Modern JavaScript offers powerful features that enhance code readability, maintainability, and efficiency. This skill package provides Claude with the necessary knowledge to leverage these features effectively, ensuring that generated or refactored code adheres to current industry standards.

## Contents

*   `SKILL.md`: The main instruction file for Claude, detailing the purpose, core knowledge, guidance, anti-patterns, and review checklist for modern JavaScript.
*   `examples/`: A collection of code examples demonstrating the correct usage of various modern JavaScript features.
*   `patterns/`: Common coding patterns and architectural approaches that utilize modern JavaScript.
*   `scripts/`: Automation scripts to assist developers with common tasks related to modern JavaScript development, such as configuration setup, code refactoring, and module conversion.
*   `README.md`: This human-readable documentation.
