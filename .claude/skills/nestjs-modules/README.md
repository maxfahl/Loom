It focuses on applying best practices for module organization, promoting reusability, enhancing scalability, and maintaining a clean, understandable architecture.

## Contents

- `SKILL.md`: The main instruction file for Claude, detailing NestJS module best practices, core knowledge, and guidance.
- `examples/`: A directory containing practical code examples demonstrating various NestJS module features and patterns.
- `patterns/`: A directory for common NestJS module code patterns and reusable snippets.
- `scripts/`: Automation scripts to assist with NestJS module generation, component generation, and feature module setup.
- `README.md`: This human-readable documentation.

## Getting Started

Refer to `SKILL.md` for detailed guidance on using NestJS modules. Explore the `examples/` directory for practical implementations and utilize the `scripts/` to automate repetitive tasks.

## Automation Scripts

The `scripts/` directory contains the following utilities:

- `nest-module-generator.py`: Interactively generates a new NestJS module with optional controller and service.
- `nest-component-generator.py`: Interactively generates a specific NestJS component within an existing or new module.
