# Immutable Audit Logging Skill

## 1. Skill Purpose

This skill enables Claude to design and implement robust, tamper-proof audit logging mechanisms in applications, ensuring that all critical system activities are recorded in an immutable fashion. This is crucial for regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), forensic analysis, and maintaining data integrity and accountability.

## 2. When to Activate This Skill

Activate this skill when the task involves:

*   Designing or implementing a new logging system where data integrity and non-repudiation are paramount.
*   Adding audit trails to sensitive operations (e.g., financial transactions, user data modifications, access control changes).
*   Meeting regulatory compliance requirements that mandate immutable record-keeping.
*   Enhancing security posture by detecting and preventing tampering with historical event data.
*   Migrating existing logging solutions to a more secure, immutable architecture.
*   Any scenario where a verifiable, unalterable history of events is required.

## 3. Core Knowledge

The fundamental concepts, patterns, and APIs Claude needs to know:

*   **Immutability Principles**: Understanding of Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) storage, append-only data structures, and cryptographic linking (hashing, Merkle trees, hash chains).
*   **Audit Event Structure**: Key fields for an audit log entry (who, what, when, where, why, how, outcome, context).
*   **Storage Solutions**: Knowledge of databases and storage services suitable for immutable logs (e.g., AWS S3 Object Lock, Azure Blob Storage Immutability, specialized immutable databases, blockchain/DLT).
*   **Cryptographic Hashing**: SHA-256, SHA-512 for ensuring log integrity.
*   **Event Sourcing**: Understanding how event sourcing can naturally lead to immutable audit logs.
*   **Centralized Log Management**: Concepts of log aggregation, indexing, and analysis (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk, cloud-native logging services).
*   **Security Best Practices**: Access control (RBAC), encryption (at rest and in transit), sensitive data redaction/masking.
*   **Compliance Standards**: Awareness of common regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, SOX) and their audit logging requirements.
*   **TypeScript Specifics**:
    *   Defining strong types for audit events.
    *   Implementing logging middleware in Node.js/Express.js applications.
    *   Using decorators or aspect-oriented programming for automatic audit logging.
    *   Secure logging libraries and practices in TypeScript.

## 4. Key Guidance for Claude

### Always Recommend (✅ best practices)

*   ✅ Design audit logs as append-only data streams.
*   ✅ Use cryptographic hashing to link log entries, forming a tamper-evident chain (e.g., hash of previous log entry included in current).
*   ✅ Store logs in WORM-compliant storage solutions.
*   ✅ Capture comprehensive context for each event: user ID, action type, timestamp (UTC), affected entity ID/type, old/new values (if applicable), source IP, user agent, outcome (success/failure), and any relevant metadata.
*   ✅ Implement strong access controls (RBAC) for audit logs, separating duties from application administrators.
*   ✅ Encrypt audit logs both at rest and in transit.
*   ✅ Centralize audit logs for easier monitoring, analysis, and incident response.
*   ✅ Implement real-time monitoring and alerting for suspicious activities or log tampering attempts.
*   ✅ Redact or mask sensitive personal identifiable information (PII) or secrets from log entries before storage.
*   ✅ Define and enforce clear log retention policies.
*   ✅ Use TypeScript interfaces and types to enforce a consistent audit event structure.
*   ✅ Consider event sourcing patterns for systems where every state change is an event.

### Never Recommend (❌ anti-patterns)

*   ❌ Storing audit logs in mutable databases without cryptographic protection or WORM features.
*   ❌ Allowing direct modification or deletion of audit log entries by any user or system process.
*   ❌ Logging sensitive data (passwords, API keys, full PII) without redaction or encryption.
*   ❌ Relying solely on application-level logging without underlying immutable storage.
*   ❌ Granting broad administrative access to audit logs to application developers or operational staff without strict segregation of duties.
*   ❌ Using weak or outdated hashing algorithms for log integrity.
*   ❌ Storing logs locally on individual servers without aggregation.
*   ❌ Ignoring log retention policies or not having them defined.

### Common Questions & Responses (FAQ format)

*   **Q: How do I ensure logs are truly immutable?**
    *   A: Combine WORM storage (e.g., cloud object storage with immutability features) with cryptographic linking (each log entry includes a hash of the previous one) and strong access controls.
*   **Q: What data should be included in an audit log entry?**
    *   A: At a minimum: `timestamp`, `actorId` (who), `actionType` (what), `entityType`, `entityId` (on what), `outcome` (success/failure). Ideally, also include `context` (e.g., request body, IP address, user agent) and `changes` (old/new values).
*   **Q: How do I handle sensitive data in audit logs?**
    *   A: Implement strict redaction or masking rules for PII, secrets, and other sensitive information *before* the log entry is stored. Never log raw sensitive data.
*   **Q: Should I use a blockchain for audit logging?**
    *   A: For extreme immutability and distributed trust, blockchain can be considered. However, it introduces complexity and cost. Evaluate if the benefits outweigh these for your specific use case. Traditional WORM storage with cryptographic chaining is often sufficient.
*   **Q: What's the role of TypeScript here?**
    *   A: TypeScript provides type safety for audit event structures, reducing errors and improving maintainability. It helps define clear contracts for log data and can be used to build robust logging middleware.

## 5. Anti-Patterns to Flag

**❌ BAD: Mutable Log Storage & Missing Context**

```typescript
// Insecure logging function
function logEvent(message: string) {
  // Logs to a simple file that can be easily edited or deleted
  // No context, no user, no timestamp, no integrity check
  console.log(`[LOG] ${message}`);
  // Or worse, directly writing to a mutable database table without any safeguards
  // db.execute(`INSERT INTO logs (message) VALUES ('${message}')`);
}

// Usage
logEvent("User 'admin' deleted a record.");
```

**✅ GOOD: Immutable Audit Logging with Type Safety and Context**

```typescript
// audit-event.interface.ts
export interface AuditEvent {
  id: string; // Unique event ID
  timestamp: string; // ISO 8601 UTC timestamp
  actor: {
    id: string;
    type: 'user' | 'system' | 'anonymous';
    ipAddress?: string;
    userAgent?: string;
  };
  action: {
    type: string; // e.g., 'USER_LOGIN', 'RECORD_DELETED', 'PERMISSION_UPDATED'
    details?: Record<string, any>; // Action-specific details
  };
  entity?: {
    type: string; // e.g., 'User', 'Product', 'Order'
    id: string;
    changes?: {
      [key: string]: {
        oldValue: any;
        newValue: any;
      };
    };
  };
  outcome: 'success' | 'failure';
  errorMessage?: string; // If outcome is failure
  previousEventHash?: string; // Cryptographic link to the previous event
  eventHash: string; // Hash of the current event data
}

// audit-logger.ts
import { createHash } from 'crypto';
import { AuditEvent } from './audit-event.interface';

class AuditLogger {
  private lastEventHash: string | undefined;
  private storageService: any; // e.g., S3 client, custom WORM DB client

  constructor(storageService: any) {
    this.storageService = storageService;
    // In a real system, you'd load the last hash from storage on startup
  }

  private calculateEventHash(event: Omit<AuditEvent, 'eventHash'>): string {
    const dataToHash = JSON.stringify({
      ...event,
      previousEventHash: this.lastEventHash || '', // Include previous hash for chaining
    });
    return createHash('sha256').update(dataToHash).digest('hex');
  }

  public async log(eventData: Omit<AuditEvent, 'id' | 'timestamp' | 'eventHash' | 'previousEventHash'>): Promise<void> {
    const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
    const id = crypto.randomUUID(); // Or a more robust ID generation

    const eventWithoutHashes: Omit<AuditEvent, 'id' | 'timestamp' | 'eventHash' | 'previousEventHash'> = {
      ...eventData,
      // Redact sensitive data here before hashing and storing
      action: {
        ...eventData.action,
        details: this.redactSensitiveData(eventData.action?.details),
      },
      entity: eventData.entity ? {
        ...eventData.entity,
        changes: this.redactSensitiveData(eventData.entity?.changes),
      } : undefined,
    };

    const previousEventHash = this.lastEventHash;
    const eventHash = this.calculateEventHash({ ...eventWithoutHashes, id, timestamp, previousEventHash });

    const fullEvent: AuditEvent = {
      id,
      timestamp,
      ...eventWithoutHashes,
      previousEventHash,
      eventHash,
    };

    // Store the event in WORM-compliant storage
    await this.storageService.saveAuditEvent(fullEvent);
    this.lastEventHash = eventHash; // Update for the next event
    console.log(`Audit event logged: ${fullEvent.action.type} by ${fullEvent.actor.id}`);
  }

  private redactSensitiveData<T>(data: T): T {
    if (!data) return data;
    const sensitiveKeys = ['password', 'apiKey', 'ssn', 'creditCardNumber']; // Example sensitive keys
    const redactedData = { ...data };
    for (const key of sensitiveKeys) {
      if ((redactedData as any)[key]) {
        (redactedData as any)[key] = '[REDACTED]';
      }
    }
    return redactedData;
  }
}

// Example Usage (in an Express.js middleware or service)
// Assume `auditStorage` is an initialized WORM-compliant storage client
// const auditLogger = new AuditLogger(auditStorage);

/*
// Example in an Express.js route handler
app.post('/users/:id', async (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id;
  const updatedUserData = req.body;
  const currentUser = req.user; // From authentication middleware

  try {
    const oldUserData = await userService.getUser(userId);
    await userService.updateUser(userId, updatedUserData);

    await auditLogger.log({
      actor: { id: currentUser.id, type: 'user', ipAddress: req.ip },
      action: { type: 'USER_UPDATED', details: { userId } },
      entity: {
        type: 'User',
        id: userId,
        changes: {
          email: { oldValue: oldUserData.email, newValue: updatedUserData.email },
          // ... other changes
        },
      },
      outcome: 'success',
    });
    res.status(200).send('User updated');
  } catch (error: any) {
    await auditLogger.log({
      actor: { id: currentUser.id, type: 'user', ipAddress: req.ip },
      action: { type: 'USER_UPDATED', details: { userId } },
      entity: { type: 'User', id: userId },
      outcome: 'failure',
      errorMessage: error.message,
    });
    res.status(500).send('Failed to update user');
  }
});

*   [ ] Are timestamps accurate, in UTC, and cryptographically protected?
*   [ ] Is sensitive data (PII, secrets) properly redacted or masked *before* logging?
*   [ ] Are access controls for the audit log system strictly enforced and separate from application access?
*   [ ] Are logs encrypted at rest and in transit?
*   [ ] Is there a centralized logging solution for aggregation and analysis?
*   [ ] Are there alerts for suspicious activity or potential log tampering?
*   [ ] Does the code use TypeScript types/interfaces to enforce the audit event structure?
