### Non-Functional Requirements: Performance and Security

**NFR-PERF-001: Page Load Time**

**Description:** The application's primary user-facing pages (e.g., Dashboard, Product Catalog, Checkout) shall load completely within 2 seconds for 95% of users under typical network conditions (broadband connection, 25 Mbps download speed).

**Measurement:** Automated browser tests (e.g., Lighthouse, WebPageTest) and real user monitoring (RUM).

**NFR-PERF-002: API Response Time**

**Description:** All critical API endpoints (e.g., `/api/auth/login`, `/api/orders`, `/api/products/{id}`) shall respond within 500 milliseconds under a load of 100 concurrent users.

**Measurement:** Load testing tools (e.g., JMeter, K6) and API monitoring.

**NFR-PERF-003: Scalability - Concurrent Users**

**Description:** The system shall support 5,000 concurrent active users without degradation in performance (as defined by NFR-PERF-001 and NFR-PERF-002).

**Measurement:** Stress testing and scalability testing.

**NFR-SEC-001: User Authentication**

**Description:** User authentication shall be performed using industry-standard protocols (e.g., OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect) and enforce strong password policies (minimum 12 characters, including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters).

**Measurement:** Security audits, penetration testing, and code review.

**NFR-SEC-002: Data Encryption (In Transit)**

**Description:** All data transmitted between the client and the server, and between internal services, shall be encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher.

**Measurement:** Network traffic analysis and security audits.

**NFR-SEC-003: Data Encryption (At Rest)**

**Description:** All sensitive user data (e.g., passwords, payment information, personally identifiable information) stored in databases or file systems shall be encrypted using AES-256 encryption.

**Measurement:** Database configuration review and security audits.

**NFR-SEC-004: Input Validation**

**Description:** All user inputs shall be rigorously validated on both the client-side and server-side to prevent common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Command Injection.

**Measurement:** Penetration testing, security scanning, and code review.
