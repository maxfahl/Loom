# Observability Stack Implementation Skill

This skill provides Claude with the knowledge and tools to implement a comprehensive observability stack using OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger. It covers best practices for collecting, storing, visualizing, and alerting on metrics, traces, and logs to gain deep insights into system behavior.

## Key Capabilities:

*   **OpenTelemetry**: Standardized instrumentation for metrics, traces, and logs.
*   **Prometheus**: Robust metrics collection and alerting.
*   **Grafana**: Powerful data visualization and dashboarding.
*   **Jaeger**: Distributed tracing for microservices.
*   **Correlation**: Linking metrics, traces, and logs for holistic troubleshooting.
*   **Automation**: Scripts for setup, configuration, and data analysis.

## How to Use This Skill:

Refer to the `SKILL.md` file for detailed instructions, core knowledge, best practices, anti-patterns, and a code review checklist. The `scripts/` directory contains automation tools to assist with observability tasks.
