# Svelte Development Skill Package

This package provides comprehensive guidance and automation tools for developing applications with Svelte and SvelteKit.

## Overview

Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Whereas traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens when you build your app. SvelteKit is the official framework for building web applications with Svelte, offering a powerful and flexible way to create everything from static sites to complex full-stack applications.

This skill package aims to equip developers with the knowledge and tools to leverage Svelte and SvelteKit effectively, focusing on best practices for performance, maintainability, and developer experience.

## Contents

-   **`SKILL.md`**: The main instruction file for Claude, detailing core knowledge, best practices, anti-patterns, and code review checklists.
-   **`examples/`**: A directory containing practical code examples demonstrating various Svelte and SvelteKit features and patterns.
-   **`patterns/`**: A directory for common Svelte and SvelteKit architectural and design patterns.
-   **`scripts/`**: A collection of automation scripts to streamline common development tasks, such as project setup, component generation, and route creation.
-   **`README.md`**: This human-readable documentation.

## Getting Started

Refer to the `SKILL.md` for detailed guidance on Svelte development. Explore the `examples/` directory for practical implementations and utilize the `scripts/` to automate your workflow.

## Automation Scripts

The `scripts/` directory contains the following utilities:

-   **`init-sveltekit.sh`**: Quickly sets up a new SvelteKit project with essential configurations.
-   **`generate-svelte-component.py`**: Generates boilerplate for Svelte components.
-   **`generate-sveltekit-route.sh`**: Automates the creation of SvelteKit route files.
-   **`generate-svelte-store.py`**: Helps in creating various types of Svelte stores.

Each script includes detailed usage instructions and examples within its file.
