## 5. Key Guidance for Claude

### Always Recommend (✅ best practices)

*   **Performance Optimization:**
    *   ✅ **Write specific `SELECT` statements:** Retrieve only necessary columns.
    *   ✅ **Filter data early:** Use `WHERE` clauses to reduce data processed.
    *   ✅ **Leverage indexing effectively:** Index frequently queried columns, avoid over-indexing, use composite indexes where appropriate. Understand index types (B-tree, hash, etc.).
    *   ✅ **Analyze query execution plans:** Regularly use `EXPLAIN` (or equivalent) to understand and optimize query performance.
    *   ✅ **Use Common Table Expressions (CTEs):** Break down complex SQL queries into readable, manageable parts.
    *   ✅ **Implement partitioning:** For very large tables to improve query performance and manageability.
    *   ✅ **Consider materialized views:** For frequently run, expensive analytical queries.
    *   ✅ **Utilize connection pooling:** To efficiently manage database connections and reduce overhead.
    *   ✅ **Batch operations:** For inserts and updates to reduce network round trips and improve throughput.
    *   ✅ **Implement caching:** At the application or database level for frequently accessed read-heavy data.

*   **Security:**
    *   ✅ **Encrypt data:** Both at rest (storage) and in transit (network communication) using TLS/SSL.
    *   ✅ **Implement robust access controls:** Follow the principle of least privilege (grant only necessary permissions). Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
    *   ✅ **Enable auditing and logging:** Track database activities for security monitoring and compliance.
    *   ✅ **Prevent SQL/NoSQL injection:** Use parameterized queries or ORM/ODM features that automatically escape inputs.
    *   ✅ **Implement row-level security:** Where granular access to data is required based on user roles.
    *   ✅ **Adopt zero-trust security models:** Verify every access request, regardless of origin.

*   **Scalability & Availability:**
    *   ✅ **Design for horizontal scaling:** Especially for NoSQL databases, by distributing data across multiple nodes (sharding).
    *   ✅ **Implement replication:** For high availability and read scalability (e.g., master-slave, multi-master, read replicas).
    *   ✅ **Plan for disaster recovery:** Regular backups, point-in-time recovery, and tested recovery procedures.
    *   ✅ **Utilize managed cloud database services:** For automated scaling, backups, and maintenance.

*   **Data Modeling & Integrity:**
    *   ✅ **Model data based on access patterns:** Especially crucial for NoSQL databases to optimize read performance.
    *   ✅ **Normalize SQL schemas:** To reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity, then selectively denormalize for performance if needed.
    *   ✅ **Define constraints:** Use primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and check constraints to enforce data integrity (SQL).
    *   ✅ **Ensure data quality:** Implement data validation, cleansing, and profiling processes.

*   **Modern Practices:**
    *   ✅ **Embrace Polyglot Persistence:** Choose the right database technology for each specific data requirement (e.g., SQL for transactional data, document DB for flexible content, graph DB for relationships, vector DB for AI embeddings).
    *   ✅ **Integrate AI/ML for operations:** Leverage AI-driven tools for performance tuning, anomaly detection, and predictive maintenance.
    *   ✅ **Adopt Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Manage database infrastructure and configurations programmatically.
    *   ✅ **Continuous Monitoring:** Set up comprehensive monitoring and alerting for database health, performance, and security.

### Never Recommend (❌ anti-patterns)

*   ❌ **`SELECT *` in production queries:** Always specify columns to reduce data transfer and processing.
*   ❌ **Ignoring `EXPLAIN` plans:** Never deploy queries to production without understanding their execution plan.
*   ❌ **Over-indexing:** Too many indexes can slow down write operations.
*   ❌ **Storing sensitive data unencrypted:** Always encrypt PII, financial data, etc.
*   ❌ **Granting excessive database permissions:** Adhere strictly to the principle of least privilege.
*   ❌ **Hardcoding credentials:** Use environment variables, secret management services (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager), or managed identity.
*   ❌ **Ignoring data backups and recovery plans:** A database without a tested backup strategy is a ticking time bomb.
*   ❌ **Using a single database type for all data needs without justification:** Avoid shoehorning all data into one database if other types are better suited.
*   ❌ **Modeling NoSQL data like a relational database:** Avoid excessive joins in application logic for document databases; denormalize appropriately.
*   ❌ **Directly concatenating user input into SQL/NoSQL queries:** This is a primary cause of injection attacks.

### Common Questions & Responses

*   **Q: "Should I use SQL or NoSQL for my new project?"**
    *   **A:** "The choice depends on your data structure, scalability needs, consistency requirements, and query patterns.
        *   **SQL (Relational):** Best for structured data, complex transactions requiring ACID compliance, strong data integrity, and when relationships between data are well-defined and critical.
        *   **NoSQL:** Best for unstructured or semi-structured data, high scalability and availability needs, rapidly evolving schemas, and when eventual consistency is acceptable. Consider specific NoSQL types (document, key-value, graph, etc.) based on your primary access patterns."

*   **Q: "How can I improve the performance of my database queries?"**
    *   **A:** "Start by analyzing your query execution plans (`EXPLAIN`). Key strategies include:
        1.  **Indexing:** Ensure appropriate indexes are on frequently queried and joined columns.
        2.  **Query Optimization:** Select only necessary columns, filter early with `WHERE` clauses, and optimize `JOIN` operations.
        3.  **Caching:** Implement application-level or database-level caching for read-heavy data.
        4.  **Denormalization (SQL):** For read-heavy tables, selectively denormalize to reduce joins, but be mindful of data integrity.
        5.  **Partitioning:** For very large tables, partition data to reduce the amount of data scanned by queries."

*   **Q: "What are the most important database security measures I should implement?"**
    *   **A:** "Prioritize these:
        1.  **Encryption:** Encrypt data at rest and in transit.
        2.  **Access Control:** Implement the principle of least privilege using RBAC.
        3.  **Injection Prevention:** Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL/NoSQL injection.
        4.  **Auditing & Logging:** Monitor and log all database activities.
        5.  **Vulnerability Management:** Regularly scan for and patch database vulnerabilities."

*   **Q: "My application needs to handle a massive amount of data and users. How do I scale my database?"**
    *   **A:** "For scalability:
        *   **Horizontal Scaling (NoSQL):** Leverage sharding and distributed architectures inherent in many NoSQL databases.
        *   **Replication:** Use read replicas to distribute read load and provide high availability.
        *   **Sharding (SQL):** For very large SQL databases, distribute data across multiple database instances.
        *   **Connection Pooling:** Efficiently manage database connections.
        *   **Caching:** Reduce database load by serving frequently accessed data from cache."

## 6. Anti-Patterns to Flag

### SQL Anti-Pattern: Function on Indexed Column

**BAD:**
```typescript
// In a SQL query builder or raw SQL
const searchTerm = 'John Doe';
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) = '${searchTerm}';`;
// This query will likely not use an index on first_name or last_name, leading to a full table scan.
```

**GOOD:**
```typescript
// In a SQL query builder or raw SQL
const firstName = 'John';
const lastName = 'Doe';
const query = `SELECT first_name, last_name, email FROM users WHERE first_name = '${firstName}' AND last_name = '${lastName}';`;
// This query can utilize indexes on first_name and last_name (or a composite index), significantly improving performance.
```
**Explanation:** Applying a function (`CONCAT`) to an indexed column in the `WHERE` clause prevents the database from using the index, forcing a full table scan. Always try to keep indexed columns in their raw form in `WHERE` clauses.

### NoSQL Anti-Pattern: Relational Modeling in Document Databases

**BAD:**
```typescript
// MongoDB example: Storing user and their posts in separate collections and "joining" in application logic
// users collection
[
  {
    _id: "user123",
    name: "Alice",
    email: "alice@example.com"
  }
]

// posts collection
[
  {
    _id: "post456",
    userId: "user123", // Foreign key reference
    title: "My First Post",
    content: "..."
  }
]

// Application code to get user with posts (N+1 problem)
const user = await db.collection('users').findOne({ _id: "user123" });
const posts = await db.collection('posts').find({ userId: user._id }).toArray();
user.posts = posts;
```

**GOOD:**
```typescript
// MongoDB example: Embedding posts within the user document (denormalization for read performance)
// users collection
[
  {
    _id: "user123",
    name: "Alice",
    email: "alice@example.com",
    posts: [
      {
        _id: "post456",
        title: "My First Post",
        content: "...",
        createdAt: "2025-10-20T10:00:00Z"
      },
      {
        _id: "post789",
        title: "Another Post",
        content: "...",
        createdAt: "2025-10-20T11:00:00Z"
      }
    ]
  }
]
// This allows fetching a user and their posts in a single query, optimizing for common access patterns.
// Consider embedding when data is frequently accessed together and the embedded array size is bounded.
```
**Explanation:** While relational databases excel at managing relationships through joins, NoSQL document databases are optimized for retrieving entire documents. "Joining" in application code leads to multiple database round trips (N+1 query problem). Embedding related data (denormalization) often improves read performance in NoSQL, especially when the embedded data is frequently accessed with the parent and its size is not excessively large.
