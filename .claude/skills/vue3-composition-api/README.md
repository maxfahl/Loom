# Vue 3 Composition API Skill

This skill provides comprehensive guidance and tools for working with the Vue 3 Composition API, focusing on best practices, TypeScript integration, and efficient development workflows.

## Overview

The Vue 3 Composition API offers a powerful way to organize and reuse logic in Vue applications. This skill helps developers and AI agents leverage its full potential by:

- **Promoting best practices:** Guiding on when and how to use `ref`, `reactive`, `computed`, `watch`, and lifecycle hooks.
- **Enhancing reusability:** Emphasizing the creation and proper use of composables.
- **Ensuring type safety:** Integrating TypeScript effectively for robust and maintainable code.
- **Streamlining development:** Providing automation scripts for common, repetitive tasks.

## Key Features

- **Detailed `SKILL.md`:** A comprehensive guide covering core concepts, best practices, common pitfalls, and a code review checklist.
- **Practical Examples:** A collection of TypeScript-first code examples demonstrating various aspects of the Composition API, including components, composables, and Pinia stores.
- **Automation Scripts:** A set of scripts designed to automate repetitive tasks, such as generating composables, scaffolding Pinia stores, and assisting with Options API to Composition API migrations.
