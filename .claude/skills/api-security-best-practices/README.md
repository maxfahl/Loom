# API Security Best Practices Skill

This directory contains the "API Security Best Practices" skill package for Claude. This skill is designed to equip Claude with comprehensive knowledge and tools to assist developers in building and maintaining secure APIs.

## Overview

In today's interconnected world, APIs are critical components of almost every application. However, they also represent a significant attack surface if not properly secured. This skill provides Claude with the necessary guidance to help identify, prevent, and mitigate common and emerging API security threats, ensuring robust and resilient API ecosystems.

## Contents

*   **`SKILL.md`**: The main instruction file detailing the purpose, core knowledge, best practices, anti-patterns, and code review checklist for API security.
*   **`examples/`**: A directory containing practical code examples (primarily in TypeScript) demonstrating secure API implementation patterns for authentication, input validation, rate limiting, and error handling.
*   **`patterns/`**: A directory for common secure API design patterns.
*   **`scripts/`**: A collection of automation scripts (shell and Python) to assist with API security auditing, secret detection, and rate limit testing.

## Key Areas Covered

*   **OWASP API Security Top 10**: Understanding and mitigating the most critical API security risks.
*   **Authentication & Authorization**: Implementing strong identity verification and granular access control.
*   **Data Protection**: Ensuring data privacy and integrity through validation, encryption, and secure handling.
*   **Threat Modeling**: Proactively identifying and addressing potential security vulnerabilities.
*   **Shift-Left Security**: Integrating security practices early into the development lifecycle.
*   **Zero-Trust Architecture**: Adopting a "never trust, always verify" approach for API access.
*   **Automated Security**: Leveraging tools and scripts for continuous security checks.

## How to Use This Skill

Developers can leverage this skill by asking Claude questions related to API security, requesting code reviews for API endpoints, seeking guidance on implementing specific security features, or utilizing the provided automation scripts to enhance their API security posture.
