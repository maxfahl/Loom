# Git Flow vs Alternative Branching Strategies

This guide helps you choose the right branching strategy for your project in 2025.

## TL;DR - Quick Decision Guide

**Use Git Flow if:**
- Versioned software releases (desktop/mobile apps, libraries)
- Multiple production versions maintained simultaneously
- Scheduled releases with extensive QA cycles
- Large teams (10+ developers)

**Use GitHub Flow if:**
- Web applications with continuous deployment
- Small-to-medium teams (2-10 developers)
- Deploy multiple times per day
- Simple workflow preferred

**Use Trunk-Based Development if:**
- Mature CI/CD pipeline with excellent test coverage
- Feature flags for incomplete work
- High deployment frequency (10+ per day)
- Advanced team with strong testing discipline

## Git Flow (Classic)

### Overview
Original branching model by Vincent Driessen (2010), designed for scheduled releases.

### Branch Structure
```
main       ──●────────────●─────────────●──────→  (releases)
               │            │             │
release/1.1    │       ─────●─────●───────┘
               │      /           │
develop    ────●────●─────●───────●───●───●───●──→  (integration)
               │   /│     │\          /│
feature/a  ────●──●─┘     │ \        / │
                          │  \      /  │
feature/b  ───────────────●───●────●───┘
```

### Pros ✅
- **Clear separation** between development and production
- **Parallel development** of features, releases, and hotfixes
- **Explicit release preparation** with dedicated branch
- **Version control** pairs perfectly with semantic versioning
- **Audit trail** with --no-ff merges preserves branch history
- **Multiple versions** can be supported simultaneously

### Cons ❌
- **Complexity** - 5 branch types to manage
- **Merge conflicts** more frequent with long-lived branches
- **Slower** - feature freeze during release preparation
- **Merge hell** when develop and main diverge
- **Overkill** for continuous deployment workflows
- **Documentation overhead** team must understand the model

### Best For
- Desktop applications (Electron, native apps)
- Mobile apps (iOS, Android)
- Libraries and SDKs
- Enterprise software with scheduled releases
- Projects requiring LTS (Long-Term Support) branches

### Example: npm (Package Manager)
```bash
# npm follows Git Flow for versioned releases
main       → v8.0.0 → v8.1.0 → v8.2.0
develop    → features for v9.0.0
release/8.3.0 → preparing next minor release
hotfix/8.1.1  → critical security patch
```

## GitHub Flow (Simplified)

### Overview
Lightweight alternative by GitHub (2011), optimized for continuous deployment.

### Branch Structure
```
main ────●─────────●─────────●─────●──────→  (always deployable)
          \       /           \   /
           \     /             \ /
feature-1   ●───●        feature-2  ●───●
```

### Workflow
1. Create branch from main
2. Develop feature
3. Open pull request
4. Review and discuss
5. Deploy for testing
6. Merge to main
7. Deploy to production

### Pros ✅
- **Simple** - only one long-lived branch (main)
- **Fast** - no release branch overhead
- **Continuous deployment** friendly
- **Easy to learn** - minimal training needed
- **Flexible** - adapt to team needs
- **Pull request centric** - great for code review

### Cons ❌
- **No release staging** - harder to batch features
- **Production must be stable** - requires excellent testing
- **Hotfixes not distinct** from features
- **Versioning** less explicit (need tags)
- **No develop branch** - main is always production-ready

### Best For
- Web applications and SaaS
- APIs and microservices
- Small to medium teams
- Projects with continuous deployment
- Open source projects

### Example: Vercel Dashboard
```bash
# Vercel uses GitHub Flow for rapid deployment
main → always production
feature/analytics → PR #123 → deploy preview → merge → production
```

---

## Trunk-Based Development (Modern)

### Overview
Single shared branch with very short-lived feature branches (<1 day) or direct commits.

### Branch Structure
```
main ────●─●─●─●─●─●─●─●─●─●──────→  (trunk)
          ╲╱ ╲╱ ╲╱ ╲╱
         (short branches: hours, not days)

OR

main ────●─●─●─●─●─●─●─●─●─●──────→  (direct commits)
```

### Workflow
1. Pull latest main
2. Create short-lived branch OR commit directly
3. Automated tests run
4. Merge to main (or commit directly)
5. Deploy automatically

### Pros ✅
- **Fastest integration** - reduces merge conflicts
- **Continuous integration** by design
- **Simple** - one branch to rule them all
- **Feature flags** allow incomplete code in production
- **High visibility** of what everyone is working on
- **Encourages small changes** - better for code review

### Cons ❌
- **Requires discipline** - needs excellent test coverage
- **Feature flags** add complexity
- **Broken builds** affect everyone
- **Advanced tooling** needed (feature flags, CI/CD)
- **Cultural shift** hard for teams used to long branches
- **Incomplete features** in codebase (behind flags)

### Best For
- High-maturity engineering teams
- Excellent automated testing
- Strong CI/CD infrastructure
- Frequent deployments (10+ per day)
- Monorepos with many contributors

### Example: Google, Facebook
```bash
# Google uses trunk-based with extensive testing
main → commit → automated tests → green → deploy
# Features hidden behind flags until ready
```

## Migration Paths

### From Git Flow to GitHub Flow

```bash
# 1. Merge all feature branches to develop
git checkout develop
git merge feature/x feature/y feature/z

# 2. Merge develop to main
git checkout main
git merge develop

# 3. Make main the primary branch
# - Update default branch in GitHub settings
# - Update CI/CD to deploy from main

# 4. Delete develop branch
git branch -d develop
git push origin --delete develop

# 5. Update team documentation
# - New workflow: feature → main
# - Deploy from main
```

### From Git Flow to Trunk-Based

```bash
# 1. Consolidate to main branch (same as GitHub Flow)

# 2. Set up feature flag system
npm install @openfeature/server-sdk

# 3. Configure CI/CD for every commit
# - Run tests on every push
# - Deploy main automatically if green

# 4. Reduce branch lifespan
# - Team guideline: merge within 24 hours
# - Use feature flags for incomplete work

# 5. Improve test coverage
# - Minimum 80% code coverage
# - Comprehensive E2E tests
```

## Hybrid Approaches

### Simplified Git Flow
```
main     → production releases
develop  → integration (skip release branches for small changes)
feature/* → feature development
hotfix/* → emergency fixes
```

**When to use:** Need structure but full Git Flow is overkill

### GitHub Flow + Staging
```
main        → production
staging     → pre-production testing
feature/*   → feature development
```

**When to use:** Need deployment staging but want simplicity

### Trunk + Release Branches
```
main         → continuous development
release/1.x  → stable release for v1.x
release/2.x  → stable release for v2.x
```

**When to use:** Multiple supported versions with trunk-based speed

---

## Decision Framework

### Step 1: Deployment Frequency
- **Multiple times per day** → Trunk-Based or GitHub Flow
- **Daily/Weekly** → GitHub Flow
- **Weekly/Monthly** → Git Flow

### Step 2: Release Style
- **Continuous (no versions)** → Trunk-Based or GitHub Flow
- **Semantic versions** → Git Flow or Hybrid
- **Multiple versions supported** → Git Flow

### Step 3: Team Maturity
- **Advanced (excellent tests, CI/CD)** → Trunk-Based
- **Intermediate** → GitHub Flow
- **Learning/Mixed levels** → Git Flow (more structure)

### Step 4: Product Type
- **Web app/SaaS** → GitHub Flow or Trunk-Based
- **Mobile/Desktop app** → Git Flow
- **Library/SDK** → Git Flow
- **API/Microservice** → GitHub Flow or Trunk-Based

## Key Takeaways

1. **No one-size-fits-all**: Choose based on your specific needs
2. **Context matters**: Team size, deployment frequency, product type
3. **Can change**: Migrate as your team matures or needs evolve
4. **Hybrid is OK**: Adapt the model to your reality
5. **Documentation**: Whatever you choose, document it clearly
