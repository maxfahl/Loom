# API Design (REST/GraphQL) Skill

This skill provides comprehensive guidance and tools for designing and implementing robust, scalable, and secure APIs using both RESTful and GraphQL architectural styles.

## Key Concepts:

*   **REST Principles**: Resource-based design, statelessness, proper HTTP method usage.
*   **GraphQL Principles**: Schema-first design, single endpoint, efficient data fetching.
*   **API Security**: Authentication, authorization, rate limiting, input validation.
*   **Performance Optimization**: Caching, pagination, N+1 problem resolution.
*   **Documentation & Versioning**: OpenAPI/Swagger, GraphQL SDL, clear versioning strategies.

## Included Scripts:

This skill includes several automation scripts to streamline API development workflows:

*   `generate-openapi-client.sh`: Automate client SDK generation from OpenAPI specifications.
*   `validate-graphql-schema.py`: Validate GraphQL schemas against best practices.
*   `api-load-test.py`: Perform basic load testing on API endpoints.
*   `api-security-scan.sh`: Integrate with security scanners for basic API security checks.
