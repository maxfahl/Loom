# Common API Versioning Patterns

This document outlines common architectural patterns and approaches used to implement API versioning effectively.

## 1. API Gateway Routing

**Description:** An API Gateway acts as a single entry point for all client requests. It can inspect incoming requests (e.g., URI path, headers) and route them to the appropriate backend service or API version. This pattern centralizes version management and decouples clients from backend service changes.

**How it works:**
- Clients send requests to the API Gateway.
- The Gateway uses rules (based on URI, headers, query params) to determine the target API version.
- Requests are forwarded to the corresponding backend service instance (e.g., `v1-service`, `v2-service`).

**Benefits:**
- Centralized control over API versions.
- Decouples clients from backend implementation details.
- Enables seamless migration and deprecation strategies.
- Can handle cross-cutting concerns like authentication, rate limiting, and logging.

**Considerations:**
- Adds an additional layer of latency.
- Requires careful configuration and management of the Gateway.

**Example Technologies:** Nginx, Kong, AWS API Gateway, Azure API Management, Google Cloud Apigee.

## 2. Client-Side Version Negotiation

**Description:** This pattern involves the client explicitly requesting a specific API version, typically through HTTP headers (e.g., `Accept` header with a custom media type or `X-API-Version`). The server then responds with the requested version of the resource.

**How it works:**
- The client includes version information in the request headers.
- The server-side application logic inspects these headers.
- Based on the requested version, the server dispatches the request to the appropriate version-specific handler or applies transformations to the response.

**Benefits:**
- Clean URLs (version information is not in the path).
- Adheres to HTTP content negotiation principles (especially with `Accept` header).
- Allows for fine-grained control over version selection by the client.

**Considerations:**
- Less discoverable than URI versioning (requires clients to know about specific headers).
- Can add complexity to server-side logic if not well-structured.
- Caching can be more complex if not handled correctly with varying `Vary` headers.

**Example Technologies:** Express.js middleware, Spring Boot content negotiation, custom HTTP header parsing.

## 3. Versioning by Module/Namespace

**Description:** In this pattern, different API versions are implemented as separate modules, namespaces, or even distinct microservices within the codebase. This provides strong separation of concerns and makes it easier to manage breaking changes.

**How it works:**
- The codebase is structured to have distinct directories or packages for each major API version (e.g., `src/v1`, `src/v2`).
- Each version's code is self-contained, minimizing interference between versions.
- Routing mechanisms (either directly in the application or via an API Gateway) direct requests to the correct version's module.

**Benefits:**
- Clear separation of concerns.
- Easier to develop, test, and deploy different versions independently.
- Reduces the risk of accidental breaking changes affecting older versions.

**Considerations:**
- Can lead to code duplication if not managed with careful abstraction.
- Increased maintenance overhead for supporting multiple distinct codebases.

**Example Technologies:** Directory structures in Node.js/Express, Python/Django/FastAPI, Java/Spring Boot.
