## Start by Reading Documentation

**BEFORE doing anything else**:

1. **Read INDEX.md**: `docs/development/INDEX.md`
   - Understand documentation structure
   - Find relevant documents for this work

2. **Follow the Trail**:
   - Read relevant documents for this domain
   - Understand project conventions
   - Review coding standards and best practices

3. **Read status.xml**: `docs/development/status.xml` (SINGLE FILE for all features)
   - Identify active feature (<is-active-feature>true</is-active-feature>)
   - Check current epic (<current-epic>)
   - Check current story (<current-story>)
   - Check current task
   - Check YOLO mode status (determines if you ask for confirmation)
   - Understand what's been completed and what's next

4. **Read Current Story** (if exists): `docs/development/features/[feature-name]/epics/[epic]/stories/[story].md`
   - Story file is THE source of truth for current work
   - Review story description and acceptance criteria
   - Check tasks and subtasks checklist
   - Understand technical details and dependencies
   - Use story checklist to track progress

5. **Clarify Feature Context**:
   - If unclear which feature, ask user: "Which feature should I work on?"
   - Read feature-specific documentation
   - Understand requirements and constraints

## YOLO Mode Behavior

**After reading status.xml, check YOLO mode**:

- If `<yolo-mode enabled="true">`: Proceed automatically at configured breakpoints
- If `<yolo-mode enabled="false">`: Stop at enabled breakpoints and ask for confirmation

**When to stop**:

- Check `<breakpoints>` configuration in status.xml
- Stop at breakpoints with `enabled="true"`
- Proceed automatically at breakpoints with `enabled="false"`
- NEVER stop for trivial decisions (variable names, comments, formatting)
- ONLY stop at major workflow transitions (dev â†’ review, test â†’ commit, etc.)

## Update status.xml When Done

**After completing your assigned work, update status.xml**:

1. Move completed task from `<current-task>` to `<completed-tasks>`

## ðŸŽ¯ Coordinator Agent Pattern

**ALWAYS route user requests through the coordinator agent for complex tasks.**

### The Coordinator Workflow

**Standard Flow:**

1. User sends message to Claude Code
2. Claude Code discusses with user to clarify requirements (if needed)
3. Claude Code gathers all necessary context (reads INDEX.md, status.xml, relevant docs)
4. Claude Code spawns coordinator agent with comprehensive, detailed prompt
5. Coordinator agent analyzes work and spawns parallel sub-agents
6. Coordinator synthesizes results and reports back

### When to Use Coordinator

**Use coordinator agent when:**

- Task involves multiple independent work streams (back-end + front-end)
- Task can benefit from parallel execution (review + implementation)
- Task is complex and requires orchestration (multiple features)
- User request needs breaking down into sub-tasks

**Examples:**

- "Implement user authentication" â†’ Coordinator spawns: senior-developer-backend + senior-developer-frontend + test-writer in parallel
- "Review code and implement next feature" â†’ Coordinator spawns: code-reviewer (for current code) + senior-developer (for new feature) in parallel
- "Fix bug and update docs" â†’ Coordinator spawns: bug-finder + documentation-writer in parallel

### Coordinator Agent Prompt Requirements

**When spawning coordinator, Claude Code MUST provide:**

1. **Complete user request** - Every detail from user's message
2. **All gathered context** - Relevant information from INDEX.md, status.xml, docs
3. **Current project state** - What's been completed, what's in progress
4. **Explicit parallelization instructions** - "Spawn as many sub-agents as possible in parallel"
5. **Sub-agent prompt guidance** - "Each sub-agent must receive extremely detailed prompt with all context"
6. **Success criteria** - What constitutes completion

**Example Coordinator Prompt:**
```

You are the coordinator agent for this task: [user request]

Context from INDEX.md: [relevant info]
Context from status.xml: [current state]
Project conventions: [from CLAUDE.md]

YOUR TASK:

1. Analyze this request and identify all parallelizable work streams
2. Spawn as many sub-agents as possible to work in parallel
3. For each sub-agent, provide EXTREMELY DETAILED prompt including:
   - Complete task description
   - All necessary context (don't lose any information)
   - Project conventions and requirements
   - Expected output format
   - Links to relevant documentation
4. Synthesize results from all sub-agents
5. Report unified findings

When spawning sub-agents, ensure:

- Back-end and front-end work happen simultaneously (if both needed)
- Code review can happen in parallel with new development
- Documentation updates can happen in parallel with implementation
- Testing can happen in parallel with other tasks

Proceed with coordinating this work.

```

### Parallelization Patterns for Coordinator

**Pattern 1: Full-Stack Feature**
```

User: "Add payment processing feature"
Coordinator spawns in parallel:

- Agent 1 (senior-developer-backend): API endpoints + database schema + payment integration
- Agent 2 (senior-developer-frontend): Payment form UI + validation + user feedback
- Agent 3 (test-writer): API tests + integration tests + E2E tests
- Agent 4 (documentation-writer): API documentation + user guide

```

**Pattern 2: Review + New Work**
```

User: "Review my authentication code and implement authorization"
Coordinator spawns in parallel:

- Agent 1 (code-reviewer): Review authentication implementation
- Agent 2 (senior-developer): Implement authorization system
- Agent 3 (test-writer): Write tests for authorization

```

**Pattern 3: Multi-Component Development**
```

User: "Build dashboard with charts, tables, and filters"
Coordinator spawns in parallel:

- Agent 1 (senior-developer): Charts component + data visualization
- Agent 2 (senior-developer): Tables component + sorting/pagination
- Agent 3 (senior-developer): Filters component + state management
- Agent 4 (senior-developer): Integration + layout + responsive design

```

### No Information Loss

**When coordinator delegates to sub-agents, it MUST:**
- Include ALL requirements from original user request
- Include ALL project context (TDD enforcement, coding standards, etc.)
- Include ALL relevant documentation references
- Include ALL success criteria
- Include ALL constraints and considerations

**Never:**
- Summarize or abbreviate the original request
- Assume sub-agents have context (they don't, give them everything)
- Skip important details to save space
- Forget to pass along project-specific requirements



3. Move next task from `<whats-next>` to `<current-task>`
4. Update `<whats-next>` with subsequent task
5. Update `<last-updated>` timestamp
6. Add note to `<notes>` if made important decisions

## Responsibilities

- TDD-focused test creation
- Unit, integration, E2E tests
- Coverage targets (80%+)
- Edge cases and errors
- Test quality

## TDD Variations

- **Fully Enforced**: Description says "Writes comprehensive tests following STRICT TDD methodology". Prompt emphasizes "Tests MUST be written BEFORE implementation"
- **Recommended**: Description says "Writes comprehensive tests following TDD best practices". Prompt emphasizes "Tests SHOULD be written before or alongside implementation"
- **No TDD**: Description says "Writes comprehensive tests for functionality". Prompt emphasizes "Add tests for critical paths and edge cases"
