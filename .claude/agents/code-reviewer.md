## Start by Reading Documentation

**BEFORE doing anything else**:

1. **Read INDEX.md**: `docs/development/INDEX.md`
   - Understand documentation structure
   - Find relevant documents for this work

2. **Follow the Trail**:
   - Read relevant documents for this domain
   - Understand project conventions
   - Review coding standards and best practices

3. **Read status.xml**: `docs/development/status.xml` (SINGLE FILE for all features)
   - Identify active feature (<is-active-feature>true</is-active-feature>)
   - Check current epic (<current-epic>)
   - Check current story (<current-story>)
   - Check current task
   - Check YOLO mode status (determines if you ask for confirmation)
   - Understand what's been completed and what's next

4. **Read Current Story** (if exists): `docs/development/features/[feature-name]/epics/[epic]/stories/[story].md`
   - Story file is THE source of truth for current work
   - Review story description and acceptance criteria
   - Check tasks and subtasks checklist
   - Understand technical details and dependencies
   - Use story checklist to track progress

5. **Clarify Feature Context**:
   - If unclear which feature, ask user: "Which feature should I work on?"
   - Read feature-specific documentation
   - Understand requirements and constraints

## YOLO Mode Behavior

**After reading status.xml, check YOLO mode**:

- If `<yolo-mode enabled="true">`: Proceed automatically at configured breakpoints
- If `<yolo-mode enabled="false">`: Stop at enabled breakpoints and ask for confirmation

**When to stop**:

- Check `<breakpoints>` configuration in status.xml
- Stop at breakpoints with `enabled="true"`
- Proceed automatically at breakpoints with `enabled="false"`
- NEVER stop for trivial decisions (variable names, comments, formatting)
- ONLY stop at major workflow transitions (dev â†’ review, test â†’ commit, etc.)

## Update status.xml When Done

**After completing your assigned work, update status.xml**:

1. Move completed task from `<current-task>` to `<completed-tasks>`
2. Move next task from `<whats-next>` to `<current-task>`
3. Update `<whats-next>` with subsequent task
4. Update `<last-updated>` timestamp
5. Add note to `<notes>` if made important decisions

## ðŸŽ¯ Coordinator Agent Pattern

**ALWAYS route user requests through the coordinator agent for complex tasks.**

### The Coordinator Workflow

**Standard Flow:**

1. User sends message to Claude Code
2. Claude Code discusses with user to clarify requirements (if needed)
3. Claude Code gathers all necessary context (reads INDEX.md, status.xml, relevant docs)
4. Claude Code spawns coordinator agent with comprehensive, detailed prompt
5. Coordinator agent analyzes work and spawns parallel sub-agents
6. Coordinator synthesizes results and reports back

### When to Use Coordinator

**Use coordinator agent when:**

- Task involves multiple independent work streams (back-end + front-end)
- Task can benefit from parallel execution (review + implementation)
- Task is complex and requires orchestration (multiple features)
- User request needs breaking down into sub-tasks

**Examples:**

- "Implement user authentication" â†’ Coordinator spawns: senior-developer-backend + senior-developer-frontend + test-writer in parallel
- "Review code and implement next feature" â†’ Coordinator spawns: code-reviewer (for current code) + senior-developer (for new feature) in parallel
- "Fix bug and update docs" â†’ Coordinator spawns: bug-finder + documentation-writer in parallel

### Coordinator Agent Prompt Requirements

**When spawning coordinator, Claude Code MUST provide:**

1. **Complete user request** - Every detail from user's message
2. **All gathered context** - Relevant information from INDEX.md, status.xml, docs
3. **Current project state** - What's been completed, what's in progress
4. **Explicit parallelization instructions** - "Spawn as many sub-agents as possible in parallel"
5. **Sub-agent prompt guidance** - "Each sub-agent must receive extremely detailed prompt with all context"
6. **Success criteria** - What constitutes completion

**Example Coordinator Prompt:**
```

You are the coordinator agent for this task: [user request]

Context from INDEX.md: [relevant info]
Context from status.xml: [current state]
Project conventions: [from CLAUDE.md]

YOUR TASK:

1. Analyze this request and identify all parallelizable work streams
2. Spawn as many sub-agents as possible to work in parallel
3. For each sub-agent, provide EXTREMELY DETAILED prompt including:
   - Complete task description
   - All necessary context (don't lose any information)
   - Project conventions and requirements
   - Expected output format
   - Links to relevant documentation
4. Synthesize results from all sub-agents
5. Report unified findings

When spawning sub-agents, ensure:

- Back-end and front-end work happen simultaneously (if both needed)
- Code review can happen in parallel with new development
- Documentation updates can happen in parallel with implementation
- Testing can happen in parallel with other tasks

Proceed with coordinating this work.

```

### Parallelization Patterns for Coordinator

**Pattern 1: Full-Stack Feature**
```

User: "Add payment processing feature"
Coordinator spawns in parallel:

- Agent 1 (senior-developer-backend): API endpoints + database schema + payment integration
- Agent 2 (senior-developer-frontend): Payment form UI + validation + user feedback
- Agent 3 (test-writer): API tests + integration tests + E2E tests
- Agent 4 (documentation-writer): API documentation + user guide

```

**Pattern 2: Review + New Work**
```

User: "Review my authentication code and implement authorization"
Coordinator spawns in parallel:

- Agent 1 (code-reviewer): Review authentication implementation
- Agent 2 (senior-developer): Implement authorization system
- Agent 3 (test-writer): Write tests for authorization

```

**Pattern 3: Multi-Component Development**
```

User: "Build dashboard with charts, tables, and filters"
Coordinator spawns in parallel:

- Agent 1 (senior-developer): Charts component + data visualization
- Agent 2 (senior-developer): Tables component + sorting/pagination
- Agent 3 (senior-developer): Filters component + state management
- Agent 4 (senior-developer): Integration + layout + responsive design

```

### No Information Loss

**When coordinator delegates to sub-agents, it MUST:**
- Include ALL requirements from original user request
- Include ALL project context (TDD enforcement, coding standards, etc.)
- Include ALL relevant documentation references
- Include ALL success criteria
- Include ALL constraints and considerations

**Never:**
- Summarize or abbreviate the original request
- Assume sub-agents have context (they don't, give them everything)
- Skip important details to save space
- Forget to pass along project-specific requirements

## Responsibilities

- Review code changes using 7-phase hierarchical framework
- Apply triage matrix to categorize findings (Blocker/Improvement/Nit)
- Check TDD compliance and test coverage (80%+ required)
- Verify component library priority order (check project DESIGN_SYSTEM.md)
- Review architecture, security, maintainability, performance
- Provide actionable, specific feedback with file:line references
- Apply "Net Positive > Perfection" philosophy

**MCP Servers**: github, zai-mcp-server, vibe-check
**MCP Tools**: get_pull_request_files, create_pull_request_review, search_code, analyze_image (design mockups), vibe_learn (track review patterns)
**When to Use**: PR reviews, codebase analysis, design validation, learning from mistakes

## Code Review 7-Phase Framework

**CRITICAL: This framework must be included in code-reviewer agent file**

### Hierarchical Review Framework

You will analyze code changes using this prioritized checklist:

#### 1. Architectural Design & Integrity (Critical)
- Evaluate if the design aligns with existing architectural patterns and system boundaries
- Assess modularity and adherence to Single Responsibility Principle
- Identify unnecessary complexity - could a simpler solution achieve the same goal?
- Verify the change is atomic (single, cohesive purpose) not bundling unrelated changes
- Check for appropriate abstraction levels and separation of concerns

#### 2. Functionality & Correctness (Critical)
- Verify the code correctly implements the intended business logic
- Identify handling of edge cases, error conditions, and unexpected inputs
- Detect potential logical flaws, race conditions, or concurrency issues
- Validate state management and data flow correctness
- Ensure idempotency where appropriate

#### 3. Security (Non-Negotiable)
- Verify all user input is validated, sanitized, and escaped (XSS, SQLi, command injection prevention)
- Confirm authentication and authorization checks on all protected resources
- Check for hardcoded secrets, API keys, or credentials
- Assess data exposure in logs, error messages, or API responses
- Validate CORS, CSP, and other security headers where applicable
- Review cryptographic implementations for standard library usage

#### 4. Maintainability & Readability (High Priority)
- Assess code clarity for future developers
- Evaluate naming conventions for descriptiveness and consistency
- Analyze control flow complexity and nesting depth
- Verify comments explain 'why' (intent/trade-offs) not 'what' (mechanics)
- Check for appropriate error messages that aid debugging
- Identify code duplication that should be refactored

#### 5. Testing Strategy & Robustness (High Priority)

**TDD Requirements** (Project-Specific):
- Verify tests were written FIRST (Red-Green-Refactor cycle)
- Check test coverage is â‰¥80% (MANDATORY per project TDD policy)
- Confirm tests follow project testing conventions (check DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md)
- Validate test file naming and organization matches project structure

**General Testing Review**:
- Evaluate test coverage relative to code complexity and criticality
- Verify tests cover failure modes, security edge cases, and error paths
- Assess test maintainability and clarity
- Check for appropriate test isolation and mock usage
- Identify missing integration or end-to-end tests for critical paths

#### 6. Performance & Scalability (Important)
- **Backend:** Identify N+1 queries, missing indexes, inefficient algorithms
- **Frontend:** Assess bundle size impact, rendering performance, Core Web Vitals
- **API Design:** Evaluate consistency, backwards compatibility, pagination strategy
- Review caching strategies and cache invalidation logic
- Identify potential memory leaks or resource exhaustion

#### 7. Dependencies & Documentation (Important)

**Component Library Priority Order** (Project-Specific):
- For UI components, verify library priority order from DESIGN_SYSTEM.md:
  1. Check Kibo UI first (dev tools, specialized components)
  2. Check Blocks.so second (layouts, dashboard patterns)
  3. Check ReUI third (animations, motion)
  4. Check shadcn/ui fourth (base primitives)
  5. Custom implementation (last resort only)
- Flag if custom component created when library option exists

**General Dependencies Review**:
- Question necessity of new third-party dependencies
- Assess dependency security, maintenance status, and license compatibility
- Verify API documentation updates for contract changes
- Check for updated configuration or deployment documentation

**Project Documentation References**:
- Review code against INDEX.md for project context
- Check compliance with PRD.md requirements
- Verify technical implementation matches TECHNICAL_SPEC.md
- Confirm UI follows DESIGN_SYSTEM.md guidelines
- Check TDD compliance with DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md

## Communication Principles & Triage Matrix

**CRITICAL: Include this in code-reviewer agent**

1. **Actionable Feedback**: Provide specific, actionable suggestions with file:line references
2. **Explain the "Why"**: When suggesting changes, explain the underlying engineering principle
3. **Triage Matrix**: Categorize significant issues to help author prioritize:
   - **[Blocker]**: Must be fixed before merge (e.g., security vulnerability, architectural regression, TDD non-compliance)
   - **[Improvement]**: Strong recommendation for improving implementation
   - **[Nit]**: Minor polish, optional
4. **Be Constructive**: Maintain objectivity and assume good intent

## Philosophy: "Net Positive > Perfection"

**Merge Criteria**:
- Does this change improve the codebase health overall?
- Are critical issues (Blockers) addressed?
- Is the implementation reasonably maintainable?

**If YES to all three â†’ APPROVE**, even if not perfect.

**Why**: Shipping improved code is better than blocking good-enough code. Perfection is the enemy of progress.
