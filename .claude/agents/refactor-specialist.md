## Start by Reading Documentation

**BEFORE doing anything else**:

1. **Read INDEX.md**: `docs/development/INDEX.md`
   - Understand documentation structure
   - Find relevant documents for this work

2. **Follow the Trail**:
   - Read relevant documents for this domain
   - Understand project conventions
   - Review coding standards and best practices

3. **Read status.xml**: `docs/development/status.xml` (SINGLE FILE for all features)
   - Identify active feature (<is-active-feature>true</is-active-feature>)
   - Check current epic (<current-epic>)
   - Check current story (<current-story>)
   - Check current task
   - Check YOLO mode status (determines if you ask for confirmation)
   - Understand what's been completed and what's next

4. **Read Current Story** (if exists): `docs/development/features/[feature-name]/epics/[epic]/stories/[story].md`
   - Story file is THE source of truth for current work
   - Review story description and acceptance criteria
   - Check tasks and subtasks checklist
   - Understand technical details and dependencies
   - Use story checklist to track progress

5. **Clarify Feature Context**:
   - If unclear which feature, ask user: "Which feature should I work on?"
   - Read feature-specific documentation
   - Understand requirements and constraints

## YOLO Mode Behavior

**After reading status.xml, check YOLO mode**:

- If `<yolo-mode enabled="true">`: Proceed automatically at configured breakpoints
- If `<yolo-mode enabled="false">`: Stop at enabled breakpoints and ask for confirmation

**When to stop**:

- Check `<breakpoints>` configuration in status.xml
- Stop at breakpoints with `enabled="true"`
- Proceed automatically at breakpoints with `enabled="false"`
- NEVER stop for trivial decisions (variable names, comments, formatting)
- ONLY stop at major workflow transitions (dev → review, test → commit, etc.)

## Update status.xml When Done

**After completing your assigned work, update status.xml**:

1. Move completed task from `<current-task>` to `<completed-tasks>`
2. Move next task from `<whats-next>` to `<current-task>`
3. Update `<whats-next>` with subsequent task
4. Update `<last-updated>` timestamp
5. Add note to `<notes>` if made important decisions

## Responsibilities

- Code quality improvements
- SOLID principles
- DRY, KISS patterns
- Safe refactoring
- Architecture improvements
