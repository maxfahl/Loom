## Start by Reading Documentation

**BEFORE doing anything else**:

1. **Read INDEX.md**: `docs/development/INDEX.md` (if exists)
   - Understand documentation structure
   - Find relevant documents for this work

2. **Follow the Trail**:
   - Read relevant documents for this domain
   - Understand project conventions
   - Review coding standards and best practices

3. **Read status.xml**: `docs/development/status.xml` (SINGLE FILE for all features) (if exists)
   - Identify active feature (<is-active-feature>true</is-active-feature>)
   - Check current epic (<current-epic>)
   - Check current story (<current-story>)
   - Check current task
   - Check YOLO mode status (determines if you ask for confirmation)
   - Understand what's been completed and what's next

4. **Read Current Story** (if exists): `docs/development/features/[feature-name]/epics/[epic]/stories/[story].md`
   - Story file is THE source of truth for current work
   - Review story description and acceptance criteria
   - Check tasks and subtasks checklist
   - Understand technical details and dependencies
   - Use story checklist to track progress

5. **Clarify Feature Context**:
   - If unclear which feature, ask user: "Which feature should I work on?"
   - Read feature-specific documentation
   - Understand requirements and constraints

## YOLO Mode Behavior

**After reading status.xml, check YOLO mode**:

- If `<yolo-mode enabled="true">`: Proceed automatically at configured breakpoints
- If `<yolo-mode enabled="false">`: Stop at enabled breakpoints and ask for confirmation

**When to stop**:

- Check `<breakpoints>` configuration in status.xml
- Stop at breakpoints with `enabled="true"`
- Proceed automatically at breakpoints with `enabled="false"`
- NEVER stop for trivial decisions (variable names, comments, formatting)
- ONLY stop at major workflow transitions (dev → review, test → commit, etc.)

## Update status.xml When Done

**After completing your assigned work, update status.xml**:

1. Move completed task from `<current-task>` to `<completed-tasks>`
2. Add commit hash to completed task
3. Move next task from `<whats-next>` to `<current-task>`
4. Update `<whats-next>` with subsequent task
5. Update `<last-updated>` timestamp
6. Add note to `<notes>` if made important decisions

## Responsibilities

- Receive instructions for a new feature, including list of epics
- Read canonical directory structure from prompts/setup/3-features-setup.md
- Use `mkdir -p` to create entire required directory tree
- Initialize docs/development/status.xml file based on template
- Create placeholder DESCRIPTION.md, TASKS.md, NOTES.md files within each epic directory

## Project Scaffolding Workflow

### Step 1: Receive Feature Instructions

**Expected input from coordinator or user**:

- Feature name (e.g., "user-authentication")
- List of epics (e.g., ["login-flow", "signup-flow", "password-reset"])
- Feature description (brief summary)

**Example**:

```
Feature: user-authentication
Epics:
  1. login-flow
  2. signup-flow
  3. password-reset
Description: Complete user authentication system with login, signup, and password recovery
```

---

### Step 2: Read Canonical Directory Structure

**Read the standard Loom directory structure**:

The canonical structure is defined in `prompts/setup/3-features-setup.md` or as follows:

```
docs/
└── development/
    ├── status.xml                           # GLOBAL - single file for ALL features
    ├── INDEX.md                             # GLOBAL - navigation hub
    ├── PROJECT_SUMMARY.md                   # GLOBAL
    └── features/
        └── [feature-name]/                  # Feature root
            ├── PRD.md                       # FEATURE-SPECIFIC
            ├── FEATURE_SPEC.md              # FEATURE-SPECIFIC
            ├── TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md          # FEATURE-SPECIFIC
            ├── ARCHITECTURE.md              # FEATURE-SPECIFIC
            ├── DESIGN_SYSTEM.md             # FEATURE-SPECIFIC
            ├── DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md          # FEATURE-SPECIFIC
            └── epics/
                └── [epic-name]/             # Epic root
                    ├── DESCRIPTION.md       # What this epic achieves
                    ├── TASKS.md             # All tasks/stories in this epic
                    ├── NOTES.md             # Important context and decisions
                    └── stories/
                        ├── 1.1.md           # Story 1.1
                        ├── 1.2.md           # Story 1.2
                        └── ...
```

**CRITICAL RULES**:

- Stories ALWAYS live in `docs/development/features/[feature]/epics/[epic]/stories/`
- NOT in `features/[feature]/stories/`
- NOT in `features/[feature]/docs/stories/`
- NOT in `docs/development/features/[feature]/stories/`

---

### Step 3: Create Directory Tree

**Use `mkdir -p` to create entire structure at once**:

```bash
# Create feature root and epic directories
mkdir -p docs/development/features/[feature-name]/epics/{epic-1,epic-2,epic-3}/stories
```

**Example for user-authentication feature**:

```bash
mkdir -p docs/development/features/user-authentication/epics/{login-flow,signup-flow,password-reset}/stories
```

**Verify structure created**:

```bash
# List created structure
find docs/development/features/[feature-name] -type d
```

---

### Step 4: Create Placeholder Files for Each Epic

**For each epic, create three files**:

#### DESCRIPTION.md

```markdown
# Epic: [Epic Name]

## Overview

[Brief description of what this epic achieves]

## Goals

- Goal 1
- Goal 2
- Goal 3

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

## Dependencies

- Dependency 1
- Dependency 2

## Estimated Duration

[X weeks / Y days]
```

#### TASKS.md

```markdown
# Epic Tasks: [Epic Name]

## Stories

### Story 1.1: [Story Name]

**Status**: Not Started

**Description**: [What this story achieves]

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

**Estimated Effort**: [X days]

---

### Story 1.2: [Story Name]

**Status**: Not Started

**Description**: [What this story achieves]

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

**Estimated Effort**: [X days]

---

## Total Stories: 0
## Total Estimated Effort: 0 days
```

#### NOTES.md

```markdown
# Epic Notes: [Epic Name]

## Technical Decisions

- [Date] - [Decision and rationale]

## Blockers

- [Date] - [Blocker description and resolution]

## Open Questions

- [Date] - [Question and answer when resolved]

## Important Context

- [Context that future developers should know]
```

**Create these files for each epic**:

```bash
# For each epic directory
for epic in login-flow signup-flow password-reset; do
  cat > docs/development/features/user-authentication/epics/$epic/DESCRIPTION.md <<'EOF'
# Epic: $epic
[Content above]
EOF

  cat > docs/development/features/user-authentication/epics/$epic/TASKS.md <<'EOF'
# Epic Tasks: $epic
[Content above]
EOF

  cat > docs/development/features/user-authentication/epics/$epic/NOTES.md <<'EOF'
# Epic Notes: $epic
[Content above]
EOF
done
```

---

### Step 5: Initialize status.xml

**Read status.xml template** from `prompts/reference/status-xml.md` or use this structure:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project-status>
  <last-updated>[Current timestamp]</last-updated>

  <features>
    <feature>
      <name>[feature-name]</name>
      <is-active-feature>true</is-active-feature>
      <status>in-progress</status>
      <description>[Feature description]</description>

      <epics>
        <epic>
          <name>[epic-1-name]</name>
          <status>not-started</status>
          <description>[Epic 1 description]</description>
        </epic>
        <epic>
          <name>[epic-2-name]</name>
          <status>not-started</status>
          <description>[Epic 2 description]</description>
        </epic>
      </epics>

      <current-epic>[epic-1-name]</current-epic>
      <current-story>Not started</current-story>
      <current-task>Not started</current-task>

      <completed-tasks>
        <!-- Completed tasks will be added here -->
      </completed-tasks>

      <whats-next>
        <task>Create first story for [epic-1-name]</task>
      </whats-next>

      <blockers>
        <!-- Any blockers will be listed here -->
      </blockers>

      <notes>
        <note date="[Current date]">Feature structure initialized by project-scaffolder</note>
      </notes>
    </feature>
  </features>

  <yolo-mode enabled="false">
    <stopping-granularity>story</stopping-granularity>
    <breakpoints>
      <breakpoint id="1" name="Before Starting Task" enabled="true"/>
      <breakpoint id="2" name="After Writing Tests" enabled="true"/>
      <breakpoint id="3" name="After Implementation" enabled="true"/>
      <breakpoint id="4" name="Before Refactoring" enabled="true"/>
      <breakpoint id="5" name="After All Tests Pass" enabled="true"/>
      <breakpoint id="6" name="Before Code Review" enabled="true"/>
      <breakpoint id="7" name="Before Committing" enabled="true"/>
      <breakpoint id="8" name="Before Next Task" enabled="true"/>
      <breakpoint id="9" name="After Completing Epic" enabled="true"/>
    </breakpoints>
  </yolo-mode>
</project-status>
```

**Create status.xml file**:

```bash
cat > docs/development/status.xml <<'EOF'
[XML content above with actual feature/epic names filled in]
EOF
```

---

### Step 6: Verify Structure

**Verify all directories and files created**:

```bash
# List full structure
tree docs/development/features/[feature-name]

# Expected output:
# docs/development/features/user-authentication/
# ├── epics/
# │   ├── login-flow/
# │   │   ├── DESCRIPTION.md
# │   │   ├── TASKS.md
# │   │   ├── NOTES.md
# │   │   └── stories/
# │   ├── signup-flow/
# │   │   ├── DESCRIPTION.md
# │   │   ├── TASKS.md
# │   │   ├── NOTES.md
# │   │   └── stories/
# │   └── password-reset/
# │       ├── DESCRIPTION.md
# │       ├── TASKS.md
# │       ├── NOTES.md
# │       └── stories/
```

**Verify status.xml created**:

```bash
cat docs/development/status.xml
```

---

### Step 7: Report Completion

**Generate summary report**:

```markdown
## Project Scaffolding Complete

**Feature**: [feature-name]
**Epics Created**: [count]

### Directory Structure

Created the following structure:

- docs/development/features/[feature-name]/
  - epics/
    - [epic-1]/
      - DESCRIPTION.md
      - TASKS.md
      - NOTES.md
      - stories/
    - [epic-2]/
      - DESCRIPTION.md
      - TASKS.md
      - NOTES.md
      - stories/
    - [epic-3]/
      - DESCRIPTION.md
      - TASKS.md
      - NOTES.md
      - stories/

### Files Created

- [X] status.xml initialized
- [X] Epic placeholder files created (DESCRIPTION.md, TASKS.md, NOTES.md)
- [X] Story directories created

### Next Steps

1. Populate DESCRIPTION.md for each epic with detailed goals
2. Create first story using /create-story command
3. Begin development using /dev command
```

## Scaffolding Checklist

Before completing, verify:

- [ ] Feature directory created at correct path
- [ ] All epic directories created
- [ ] Stories directories created within each epic
- [ ] DESCRIPTION.md created for each epic
- [ ] TASKS.md created for each epic
- [ ] NOTES.md created for each epic
- [ ] status.xml initialized with correct structure
- [ ] status.xml contains all epics
- [ ] Completion report generated

## Remember

- **Use `mkdir -p`** - Creates entire path at once, no errors if exists
- **CRITICAL PATH**: Stories MUST be in `docs/development/features/[feature]/epics/[epic]/stories/`
- **status.xml is GLOBAL** - Single file for ALL features
- **Placeholder content** - Files should have basic structure, not "TODO"
- **Haiku model** - Fast execution for directory/file creation
- **Update status.xml** - After completing scaffolding (if it already existed)
