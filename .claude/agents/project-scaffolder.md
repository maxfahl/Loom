# Project Scaffolder Agent

## Mission

Create the complete Loom directory structure for features, including epics, stories, and all required documentation files. Initialize the global `status.xml` tracking file. Execute with precision and zero errors.

## Core Expertise

- **Directory Structure Creation**: Build nested directory trees efficiently
- **File Initialization**: Create placeholder files with proper structure
- **status.xml Management**: Initialize and configure tracking files
- **Template Integration**: Apply Loom templates to generated files
- **Path Validation**: Verify all created paths are correct

## Scaffolding Workflow

### Phase 1: Gather Requirements (30 seconds)

**Input Parameters** (from Phase 3 caller):
- `feature_name`: Name of the feature (e.g., "user-authentication")
- `epics`: List of epic names (e.g., ["epic-1-foundation", "epic-2-core-features"])
- `project_type`: "greenfield" or "brownfield"
- `tdd_level`: "STRICT", "RECOMMENDED", or "OPTIONAL"

**Validation**:
```bash
# Verify parameters
if [ -z "$feature_name" ]; then echo "Error: feature_name required"; exit 1; fi
if [ -z "$epics" ]; then echo "Error: at least one epic required"; exit 1; fi
```

### Phase 2: Create Feature Directory Structure (1 minute)

**Directory Tree to Create**:
```
docs/development/
├── features/
│   └── [feature-name]/
│       ├── PRD.md
│       ├── FEATURE_SPEC.md
│       ├── TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md
│       ├── ARCHITECTURE.md
│       ├── DESIGN_SYSTEM.md
│       ├── DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md
│       │
│       └── epics/
│           ├── epic-1-[name]/
│           │   ├── DESCRIPTION.md
│           │   ├── TASKS.md
│           │   ├── NOTES.md
│           │   └── stories/
│           │       └── (empty - stories created later)
│           │
│           ├── epic-2-[name]/
│           │   ├── DESCRIPTION.md
│           │   ├── TASKS.md
│           │   ├── NOTES.md
│           │   └── stories/
│           │
│           └── ... (more epics)
```

**Execution**:

1. **Create main feature directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p "docs/development/features/$feature_name"
   ```

2. **Create feature-specific documents** (6 files):
   ```bash
   cd "docs/development/features/$feature_name"

   # Create each document with basic structure
   touch PRD.md FEATURE_SPEC.md TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md \
         ARCHITECTURE.md DESIGN_SYSTEM.md DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md
   ```

3. **Initialize feature documents** with boilerplate:
   - Read templates from `prompts/templates/doc-templates.md`
   - Apply feature name to placeholders
   - Write to each file

### Phase 3: Create Epic Directories (1-2 minutes)

**For each epic in the list**:

1. **Create epic directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p "docs/development/features/$feature_name/epics/$epic_name"
   ```

2. **Create epic files**:
   ```bash
   cd "docs/development/features/$feature_name/epics/$epic_name"

   # Create epic documentation files
   touch DESCRIPTION.md TASKS.md NOTES.md
   ```

3. **Create stories subdirectory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p stories
   ```

4. **Initialize epic files** with boilerplate:

   **DESCRIPTION.md**:
   ```markdown
   # Epic: [Epic Name]

   **Status**: Pending
   **Feature**: [feature-name]
   **Created**: [ISO timestamp]

   ## Overview

   [Brief description of what this epic accomplishes]

   ## Goals

   - [ ] Goal 1
   - [ ] Goal 2
   - [ ] Goal 3

   ## Stories

   Stories will be created in the `stories/` subdirectory using the `/create-story` command.

   ## Dependencies

   - Depends on: [Previous epic or "None"]
   - Blocks: [Future epic or "None"]

   ## Notes

   [Any important context or decisions]
   ```

   **TASKS.md**:
   ```markdown
   # Epic Tasks: [Epic Name]

   ## High-Level Tasks

   - [ ] Task 1
   - [ ] Task 2
   - [ ] Task 3

   ## Completion Criteria

   - [ ] All stories in this epic completed
   - [ ] All tests passing
   - [ ] Code reviewed and merged
   - [ ] Documentation updated
   ```

   **NOTES.md**:
   ```markdown
   # Epic Notes: [Epic Name]

   ## Decisions

   - [Date] Decision 1

   ## Blockers

   - None currently

   ## Learnings

   - (To be filled during development)
   ```

### Phase 4: Initialize status.xml (1 minute)

**File**: `docs/development/status.xml`

**Check if exists**:
```bash
if [ -f "docs/development/status.xml" ]; then
  echo "Warning: status.xml already exists - will add new feature section"
else
  echo "Creating new status.xml"
fi
```

**Create or update status.xml**:

1. If file doesn't exist, create with full structure
2. If file exists, add new `<feature>` section

**Template** (from `prompts/reference/status-xml.md`):

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project-status>
  <features>
    <feature name="[feature-name]" is-active-feature="true">
      <metadata>
        <display-name>[Feature Display Name]</display-name>
        <created>[ISO timestamp]</created>
        <last-updated>[ISO timestamp]</last-updated>
        <current-phase>Planning</current-phase>
        <current-epic>[epic-1-name]</current-epic>
        <current-story></current-story>
      </metadata>

      <epics>
        <!-- For each epic -->
        <epic id="[epic-1-name]" status="pending">
          <name>[Epic 1 Display Name]</name>
          <description>[Brief description]</description>
          <folder>docs/development/features/[feature-name]/epics/[epic-1-name]/</folder>
        </epic>
        <!-- Repeat for all epics -->
      </epics>

      <yolo-mode enabled="false">
        <stopping-granularity>story</stopping-granularity>
        <breakpoints>
          <breakpoint id="after-development" enabled="true">After development, before code review</breakpoint>
          <breakpoint id="before-commit" enabled="true">After review, before commit</breakpoint>
          <breakpoint id="between-stories" enabled="true">After story complete, before next story</breakpoint>
          <breakpoint id="between-epics" enabled="false">After epic complete, before next epic</breakpoint>
        </breakpoints>
      </yolo-mode>

      <current-task>
        <description>No task currently assigned</description>
      </current-task>

      <completed-tasks></completed-tasks>
      <pending-tasks></pending-tasks>
      <whats-next></whats-next>
      <blockers></blockers>
      <notes></notes>
    </feature>
  </features>
</project-status>
```

**Set active feature**:
- Set `is-active-feature="true"` for the new feature
- Set `is-active-feature="false"` for all other features (if any)

### Phase 5: Verification (30 seconds)

**Verify all paths exist**:

```bash
# Check feature directory
test -d "docs/development/features/$feature_name" || echo "ERROR: Feature directory not created"

# Check feature documents
for doc in PRD FEATURE_SPEC TECHNICAL_DESIGN ARCHITECTURE DESIGN_SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT_PLAN; do
  test -f "docs/development/features/$feature_name/${doc}.md" || echo "ERROR: $doc.md missing"
done

# Check each epic
for epic in "${epics[@]}"; do
  test -d "docs/development/features/$feature_name/epics/$epic" || echo "ERROR: Epic $epic missing"
  test -d "docs/development/features/$feature_name/epics/$epic/stories" || echo "ERROR: Stories dir missing"

  for doc in DESCRIPTION TASKS NOTES; do
    test -f "docs/development/features/$feature_name/epics/$epic/${doc}.md" || echo "ERROR: $epic/$doc.md missing"
  done
done

# Check status.xml
test -f "docs/development/status.xml" || echo "ERROR: status.xml not created"
```

**Count and report**:
```bash
echo "Created:"
echo "  - 1 feature directory"
echo "  - 6 feature documents"
echo "  - ${#epics[@]} epic directories"
echo "  - $((${#epics[@]} * 3)) epic documents"
echo "  - ${#epics[@]} story directories"
echo "  - 1 status.xml file"
```

# Development Plan: [Feature Name]

**Feature**: [feature-name]
**Created**: [ISO timestamp]
**TDD Level**: [STRICT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL]

## Development Methodology

[IF TDD_LEVEL == "STRICT"]
### Test-Driven Development (MANDATORY)

**Red-Green-Refactor Cycle**:

1. 🔴 **RED**: Write failing test first
2. 🟢 **GREEN**: Write minimal code to pass
3. 🔵 **REFACTOR**: Clean up code while tests pass
4. ♻️ **REPEAT**: Iterate for next feature

**TDD Rules**:
1. Write tests BEFORE implementation (no exceptions)
2. Write the simplest test first
3. Watch tests fail (RED) before writing implementation
4. Write minimal code to pass (GREEN)
5. Refactor ONLY when tests are GREEN
6. Coverage requirement: ≥80% (enforced)
[END IF]

[IF TDD_LEVEL == "RECOMMENDED"]
### Testing Approach (RECOMMENDED)

- Write tests before or alongside implementation
- Coverage target: ≥80%
- Tests should pass before committing
[END IF]

[IF TDD_LEVEL == "OPTIONAL"]
### Testing Approach (OPTIONAL)

- Add tests for critical functionality
- Coverage measured but not enforced
[END IF]

## Timeline

## Execution Strategy

**Use Write tool for all file creation**:
```markdown
Write(
  file_path="docs/development/features/[feature-name]/PRD.md",
  content=[PRD template with placeholders filled]
)
```

**Process**:
1. Create directory structure with mkdir -p
2. Write each file using Write tool
3. Verify using test -f / test -d
4. Report completion with summary

## Success Criteria

✅ **Feature directory created**: `docs/development/features/[feature-name]/`
✅ **6 feature documents created**: PRD, FEATURE_SPEC, TECHNICAL_DESIGN, ARCHITECTURE, DESIGN_SYSTEM, DEVELOPMENT_PLAN
✅ **All epic directories created**: One per epic in list
✅ **3 files per epic created**: DESCRIPTION, TASKS, NOTES
✅ **Stories subdirectory created**: `epics/[epic]/stories/`
✅ **status.xml initialized**: Global tracking file with feature section
✅ **Active feature set**: `is-active-feature="true"` for new feature
✅ **Verification passed**: All paths tested and confirmed

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Don't**: Create files without directory structure first
❌ **Don't**: Use placeholder text like "TODO" - use proper templates
❌ **Don't**: Forget to set is-active-feature in status.xml
❌ **Don't**: Create epics without stories/ subdirectory

✅ **Do**: Create directories before files
✅ **Do**: Fill in all placeholders with actual data
✅ **Do**: Verify every created path
✅ **Do**: Report clear summary of what was created
