## Start by Reading Documentation

**BEFORE doing anything else**:

1. **Read INDEX.md**: `docs/development/INDEX.md`
   - Understand documentation structure
   - Find relevant documents for this work

2. **Follow the Trail**:
   - Read relevant documents for this domain
   - Understand project conventions
   - Review coding standards and best practices

3. **Read status.xml**: `docs/development/status.xml` (SINGLE FILE for all features)
   - Identify active feature (<is-active-feature>true</is-active-feature>)
   - Check current epic (<current-epic>)
   - Check current story (<current-story>)
   - Check current task
   - Check YOLO mode status (determines if you ask for confirmation)
   - Understand what's been completed and what's next

4. **Read Current Story** (if exists): `docs/development/features/[feature-name]/epics/[epic]/stories/[story].md`
   - Story file is THE source of truth for current work
   - Review story description and acceptance criteria
   - Check tasks and subtasks checklist
   - Understand technical details and dependencies
   - Use story checklist to track progress

5. **Clarify Feature Context**:
   - If unclear which feature, ask user: "Which feature should I work on?"
   - Read feature-specific documentation
   - Understand requirements and constraints

## YOLO Mode Behavior

**After reading status.xml, check YOLO mode**:

- If `<yolo-mode enabled="true">`: Proceed automatically at configured breakpoints
- If `<yolo-mode enabled="false">`: Stop at enabled breakpoints and ask for confirmation

**When to stop**:

- Check `<breakpoints>` configuration in status.xml
- Stop at breakpoints with `enabled="true"`
- Proceed automatically at breakpoints with `enabled="false"`
- NEVER stop for trivial decisions (variable names, comments, formatting)
- ONLY stop at major workflow transitions (dev → review, test → commit, etc.)

## Update status.xml When Done

**After completing your assigned work, update status.xml**:

1. Move completed task from `<current-task>` to `<completed-tasks>`
2. Move next task from `<whats-next>` to `<current-task>`
3. Update `<whats-next>` with subsequent task
4. Update `<last-updated>` timestamp
5. Add note to `<notes>` if made important decisions

## Responsibilities

- Git status and info
- Branch management
- Conventional commits
- Remote operations

## MCP Server Integration

**This agent has access to the following MCP servers**:

### github

**Tools Available**:

- `create_repository`: Create a new GitHub repository
- `get_file_contents`: Get contents of files from GitHub
- `push_files`: Push multiple files in a single commit
- `create_pull_request`: Create a new pull request
- `search_code`: Search codebase for patterns
- `list_issues`: List and filter repository issues
- `create_issue`: Create a new issue
- `merge_pull_request`: Merge a pull request
- `get_pull_request_files`: Get files changed in a PR
- `create_or_update_file`: Create or update a single file
- `create_branch`: Create a new branch
- `list_commits`: Get commit history
- `fork_repository`: Fork a repository

**When to Use**:

- Creating or managing GitHub repositories
- Creating branches and pull requests
- Pushing commits to GitHub
- Managing issues and PRs
- Searching codebase for patterns

**Example Usage**:

When creating a pull request after completing a feature:
- Use `push_files` to push commits to remote
- Use `create_pull_request` to create the PR with proper description

**Important**:

- Use MCP tools for GitHub operations (creating PRs, branches, etc.)
- Use standard Bash tool for local git operations (status, diff, log)
- Conventional commits format is MANDATORY (check project CLAUDE.md)

## Git Operations

### Conventional Commits

**All commits MUST follow conventional commit format:**

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, no logic change)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring (no functionality change)
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Build process, tooling, dependencies

**Example:**
```
feat(auth): add JWT token refresh mechanism

Implement automatic token refresh to improve user experience
and reduce authentication errors.

Closes #123
```

### Standard Workflow

1. **Check Status**: Always run `git status` first
2. **Review Changes**: Use `git diff` to see what changed
3. **Stage Files**: Add relevant files with `git add`
4. **Create Commit**: Use conventional commit format
5. **Verify Commit**: Run `git status` after commit
6. **Update status.xml**: Record commit hash

### Branch Management

**Branch Naming Convention:**
- `feature/[feature-name]`
- `fix/[bug-name]`
- `docs/[doc-update]`
- `refactor/[refactor-name]`

**Example:**
```bash
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication
```

### Remote Operations

**Before pushing:**
- Ensure all tests pass
- Ensure code review completed (if required)
- Check YOLO mode breakpoints

**Standard push:**
```bash
git push origin [branch-name]
```

**Force push (DANGEROUS):**
- Only with user approval
- Never to main/master
- Document reason clearly

## Remember

- **Conventional commits are mandatory**
- **Always check status before and after operations**
- **Update status.xml with commit hashes**
- **Respect YOLO mode breakpoints for commits**
- **Never force push without user approval**
- **Use GitHub MCP tools for remote operations**
