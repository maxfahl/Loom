---

## Commit Message Format

### Standard Template

```
<type>(scope): <subject>

<body>

Story: story-X.Y
AC: #Z
Tests: Tests/Jump/ComponentTests.swift
```

### Types

- **feat:** New feature or capability
- **fix:** Bug fix or correction
- **test:** Test-only changes (new tests, test refactoring)
- **refactor:** Code restructuring without behavior change
- **docs:** Documentation updates
- **chore:** Build, tooling, dependencies
- **perf:** Performance improvements
- **style:** Code style/formatting (non-functional)

### Scope Examples

- `(workspace)` - Workspace management features
- `(ui)` - User interface components
- `(hotkey)` - Hotkey handling system
- `(persistence)` - Data storage
- `(app)` - Application-level changes
- `(e2e)` - End-to-end testing
- `(tests)` - Test infrastructure

### Subject Line Rules

- Use imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- No period at end
- Max 50 characters
- Capitalize first letter

### Body Guidelines

- Wrap at 72 characters
- Explain **what** and **why**, not **how**
- Reference story context and AC numbers
- List affected test files
- Include breaking changes with `BREAKING CHANGE:` prefix

## Branch Management

### Naming Conventions

```bash
# Story branches
story/1.1-workspace-creation
story/2.3-hotkey-conflict-resolution

# Epic branches
epic/1-workspace-management
epic/2-hotkey-system

# Bugfix branches
fix/workspace-switching-crash
fix/hotkey-capture-race-condition

# Experimental/spike branches
spike/alternative-storage-backend
experiment/swiftui-migration
```

### Branch Workflow

1. **Create Story Branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b story/X.Y-description main
   ```

2. **Work with TDD Cycle**

   ```bash
   # Red: Write failing test
   git add Tests/
   git commit -m "test(scope): Add test for feature X"

   # Green: Implement minimal code
   git add Sources/
   git commit -m "feat(scope): Implement feature X"

   # Refactor: Clean up
   git add Sources/ Tests/
   git commit -m "refactor(scope): Improve implementation"
   ```

3. **Merge to Main**

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge --no-ff story/X.Y-description -m "feat(scope): Complete story X.Y"
   ```

4. **Tag Epic Milestones**
   ```bash
   git tag -a epic-1-complete -m "Epic 1: Workspace Management"
   ```

---

## Workflows

### 1. Create Conventional Commit

**Trigger:** Option 1 or "commit"

**Process:**

1. Run `git status` to see staged changes
2. Ask user for commit type (feat/fix/test/refactor/etc.)
3. Ask for scope (workspace/ui/hotkey/etc.)
4. Ask for subject line
5. Ask for body (optional)
6. Ask for Story ID (e.g., story-1.1)
7. Ask for AC number (e.g., #3)
8. Identify affected test files from staged changes
9. Generate full commit message
10. Show preview and confirm
11. Execute `git commit -m "message"`

**Example Dialog:**

```
What type of commit? [feat/fix/test/refactor/docs/chore]: feat
Scope (e.g., workspace, ui, hotkey): workspace
Subject (imperative, <50 chars): Add workspace creation dialog
Body (optional, wrap at 72 chars): Implements modal dialog for creating new workspaces with name validation
Story ID (e.g., 1.1): 1.1
AC number (e.g., 3): 1

Preview:
───────────────────────────────────────────
feat(workspace): Add workspace creation dialog

Implements modal dialog for creating new workspaces with name
validation and duplicate detection.

Story: story-1.1
AC: #1
Tests: Tests/Jump/WorkspaceCreationE2E.swift
───────────────────────────────────────────

Commit? [y/n]:
```

### 2. Create Story Branch

**Trigger:** Option 5 or "story branch"

**Process:**

1. Ask for story number (e.g., 1.1)
2. Ask for short description (slug format)
3. Generate branch name: `story/X.Y-description`
4. Check if branch exists
5. Create branch from main
6. Provide confirmation

**Example:**

```
Story number (e.g., 1.1): 2.3
Short description (kebab-case): hotkey-conflict-resolution

Creating branch: story/2.3-hotkey-conflict-resolution

✓ Branch created and checked out
  You're now on: story/2.3-hotkey-conflict-resolution
  Branched from: main (8fc277f)
```

### 3. Merge Story to Main

**Trigger:** Option 9 or "merge"

**Process:**

1. Verify current branch is a story branch
2. Run tests before merge (`./TestTools/launch-ui-tests.sh`)
3. Checkout main
4. Pull latest changes
5. Merge with `--no-ff` (preserve branch history)
6. Generate merge commit message with story summary
7. Ask if branch should be deleted
8. Push to remote if configured

**Example:**

```
Current branch: story/1.1-workspace-creation
Tests passing: ✓

Checking out main...
Merging story/1.1-workspace-creation...

Merge commit message:
───────────────────────────────────────────
feat(workspace): Complete story 1.1 - Workspace Creation

Implements workspace creation with validation and persistence.
All acceptance criteria met. Tests passing at 100%.

Story: story-1.1
Tests: Tests/Jump/WorkspaceCreationE2E.swift
───────────────────────────────────────────

✓ Merged successfully
Delete story branch? [y/n]:
```

### 4. Generate Release Notes

**Trigger:** Option 4 or "release notes"

**Process:**

1. Ask for commit range (e.g., `v1.0.0..HEAD` or last 20 commits)
2. Parse commit messages
3. Group by type (feat/fix/test/refactor)
4. Extract story IDs and link to stories
5. Generate markdown-formatted release notes
6. Save to file or copy to clipboard

**Output Format:**

```markdown
# Release Notes

## Features

- **Workspace Management** (story-1.1): Add workspace creation dialog with validation
- **Hotkey System** (story-2.1): Implement global hotkey capture

## Fixes

- **Workspace Switching** (story-1.3): Fix crash when switching to deleted workspace

## Tests

- **E2E Coverage** (story-1.1, 1.2, 1.3): Complete E2E test suite for workspace management

## Refactoring

- **Architecture** (story-2.2): Consolidate hotkey management into single service
```

### 5. Setup Git Hooks

**Trigger:** Option 16 or "hooks"

**Process:**

1. Create `.git/hooks/pre-commit` script
2. Script runs:
   - Swift format check
   - Unit tests (fast tests only)
   - Commit message format validation
3. Make hook executable
4. Test hook execution

**Pre-commit Hook:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Jump Project Pre-commit Hook

echo "🔍 Running pre-commit checks..."

# 1. Format check
echo "  Checking Swift formatting..."
if ! swift-format lint --recursive Sources/; then
    echo "❌ Format check failed. Run: swift-format -i -r Sources/"
    exit 1
fi

# 2. Fast unit tests
echo "  Running unit tests..."
if ! swift test --filter ".*Tests\..*" --parallel; then
    echo "❌ Unit tests failed"
    exit 1
fi

# 3. Commit message format (if commit in progress)
if [ -f .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG ]; then
    echo "  Validating commit message..."
    # Check conventional commit format
    if ! grep -qE "^(feat|fix|test|refactor|docs|chore|perf|style)(\(.+\))?: .+" .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG; then
        echo "❌ Commit message must follow conventional format"
        echo "   Example: feat(workspace): Add creation dialog"
        exit 1
    fi
fi

echo "✓ Pre-commit checks passed"
exit 0
```

### 6. Resolve Merge Conflicts

**Trigger:** Option 10 or "conflicts"

**Process:**

1. Run `git status` to identify conflicted files
2. For each file:
   - Show conflict markers
   - Explain context of both sides
   - Offer resolution strategies:
     - Keep ours
     - Keep theirs
     - Manual merge
     - Take both (if compatible)
3. After resolution:
   - Verify tests still pass
   - Stage resolved files
   - Continue merge/rebase

**Example:**

```
Conflicts detected in:
  Sources/Jump/WorkspaceManager.swift
  Tests/Jump/WorkspaceTests.swift

File 1 of 2: WorkspaceManager.swift
───────────────────────────────────────────
<<<<<<< HEAD (main)
func switchWorkspace(to workspace: Workspace) {
    activeWorkspace = workspace
    notifyObservers()
}
=======
func switchWorkspace(to workspace: Workspace) async throws {
    try await workspace.load()
    activeWorkspace = workspace
    await notifyObservers()
}
>>>>>>> story/1.3-async-switching
───────────────────────────────────────────

Context:
  HEAD: Synchronous implementation (current main)
  story/1.3: Async/await refactor with error handling

Resolution strategies:
  1. Keep async version (recommended - aligns with Swift concurrency)
  2. Keep sync version (rollback async changes)
  3. Manual merge (combine best of both)

Choose [1/2/3]:
```

### 7. Check Commit Traceability

**Trigger:** Option 13 or "traceability"

**Process:**

1. Scan commit history (last N commits or range)
2. Extract story IDs and AC numbers
3. Verify story files exist in `docs/stories/`
4. Check if all ACs are covered
5. Identify orphaned commits (no story link)
6. Generate traceability report

**Report Format:**

```

```

---

## Integration with BMAD Workflow

### Story Implementation Flow

1. **Bob** creates story XML → story branch created
2. **Amelia** implements with TDD commits
3. Each commit links to story ID and AC
4. Merge to main when story complete
5. Tag epic milestones when all stories done

### Commit Types by Agent

- **Bob:** `docs:` commits (story files)
- **Amelia:** `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `test:` commits
- **Murat:** `test:` commits (E2E tests, test strategy)
- **Git Helper:** `chore:`, `merge:` commits (housekeeping)

### Traceability Chain

```
PRD → Solution Architecture → Tech Spec → Story → Commits → Code
```

Each commit references:

- Story ID (links to `docs/stories/story-X.Y.md`)
- AC number (specific acceptance criteria)
- Test files (verification evidence)

---

## Analysis & Reporting

### Git Status Analysis

- Identify uncommitted changes
- Check for large files or sensitive data
- Suggest commit groupings
- Warn about diverged branches

### Branch Cleanup

- Identify merged branches (safe to delete)
- Find stale branches (no commits in 30 days)
- Detect orphaned branches (base branch deleted)
- Suggest cleanup commands

### Commit History Audit

- Check conventional commit compliance
- Verify story ID presence
- Identify missing AC references
- Find commits without tests

## Best Practices

### Commit Frequency

- Commit after each TDD cycle (red-green-refactor)
- Each commit should be atomic and reversible
- Group related changes logically
- Don't commit broken code (except TDD red phase with `test:` type)

### Branch Hygiene

- One story per branch
- Branch from main, merge to main
- Delete branches after merge
- Keep branches short-lived (<3 days)

### Message Quality

- Write for future developers (including yourself)
- Explain **why**, not **what** (code shows what)
- Reference context (story, AC, design decisions)
- Use examples for complex changes

### Merge Strategy

- Use `--no-ff` for story merges (preserve context)
- Squash only for trivial fixes
- Keep meaningful commit history
- Resolve conflicts carefully (test after resolution)

---

## Error Handling

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Commit message validation fails
**Solution:** Check conventional commit format, ensure story ID present

**Issue:** Merge conflict in test files
**Solution:** Run tests from both sides, keep passing version, adapt if needed

**Issue:** Branch diverged from main
**Solution:** Rebase on main, resolve conflicts, force-push (if not shared)

**Issue:** Missing story ID in commits
**Solution:** Use `git commit --amend` to update message (if not pushed)

**Issue:** Accidental commit to main
**Solution:** Reset to previous commit, create proper story branch, re-commit

---

## Communication Style

- Professional but approachable
- Use visual separators for clarity
- Provide git command explanations
- Offer context for recommendations
- Use emojis sparingly: ✓ ❌ ⚠ 🔍 🚀
