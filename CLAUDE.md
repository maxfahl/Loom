# Loom - AI-Native Development Framework

**Weave features autonomously with test-driven development and epic-based tracking.**

Loom is a **meta-framework** - a prompt-based development system that sets up AI development environments with autonomous agents, slash commands, and comprehensive documentation. It's not code you write; it's a system AI agents use to organize and execute your development projects.

---

## üéØ CRITICAL RULES (NEVER VIOLATE)

### Meta-Prompt Integrity (ABSOLUTE)

- ‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Skipping phases or reordering them
- ‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Asking unnecessary questions in UPDATE mode
- ‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Copying project-specific docs from template (must regenerate)
- ‚úÖ **REQUIRED**: Follow meta-prompt phases in exact order
- ‚úÖ **REQUIRED**: Create ALL required documentation files
- ‚úÖ **REQUIRED**: Generate agents with template if TEMPLATE mode requested
- ‚úÖ **REQUIRED**: Trust existing project structure unless validating

### Agent Generation (ABSOLUTE)

- ‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Creating agents from scratch without templates
- ‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Modifying agent structure without testing
- ‚úÖ **REQUIRED**: Use agent templates from Loom/prompts/reference/core-agents.md
- ‚úÖ **REQUIRED**: Verify agents are functional (can be invoked by name)
- ‚úÖ **REQUIRED**: Create BOTH markdown agent files AND test invocations

### Documentation Completeness (ABSOLUTE)

- ‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Creating setup without all 15+ required docs
- ‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Partial feature implementation (must be complete)
- ‚ùå **REQUIRED**: All documentation files created per phase
- ‚úÖ **REQUIRED**: INDEX.md updated with all document references
- ‚úÖ **REQUIRED**: status.xml created and properly initialized

---

## üìä Project Status

**Framework**: BUILT (Loom is a documentation/prompt system, not executable code)
**Components**:
- 16+ core agents (coordinator, senior-developer, codebase-analyzer, etc.)
- 16+ slash commands (/dev, /loom-status, /fix, /one-off, etc.)
- 15+ documentation files (PRD, TECHNICAL_SPEC, ARCHITECTURE, etc.)
- Distinct setup, update, and preparation workflows.

**Test Coverage**: N/A (meta-framework, not executable)
**Current Activity**: Documentation and agent framework maintained

---

## üéØ Coordinator Agent Pattern

**All complex Loom operations flow through the coordinator agent.**

### When to Use Coordinator

- **Multi-phase setup**: New project initialization with all 7 phases
- **Full project updates**: Existing project update with all 6 phases
- **Complex orchestration**: Multiple parallel agent generations
- **Integration work**: Bridging between agents and documentation

### Standard Workflow

1. User provides project context (name, tech stack, requirements)
2. Claude Code reads Loom meta-prompt orchestrator
3. Claude Code spawns **coordinator agent** with comprehensive prompt
4. Coordinator spawns **parallel sub-agents** for each phase work
5. Coordinator synthesizes results and verifies completeness

### Example: NEW PROJECT Setup Workflow

**Coordinator spawns in parallel**:

- **Phase 1-2 agents**: Discovery & planning (research tech stack, define features)
- **Phase 3 agents**: Design (create PRD, TECHNICAL_SPEC, ARCHITECTURE)
- **Phase 4 agents**: Implementation agents (create agents, commands, docs)
- **Phase 5-6 agents**: Testing & verification agents
- **Documentation agent**: Coordinate all doc creation and INDEX updates

### Critical Rule

**COORDINATOR MUST PASS ALL CONTEXT TO SUB-AGENTS.**

- Include project requirements
- Include previous phase outputs
- Include template project path (if TEMPLATE mode)
- NO information loss during delegation

---

## ‚ö° Parallel Agent Execution Strategy (CRITICAL)

**ALWAYS utilize multiple agents in parallel whenever possible.**

### Why Parallelize?

- **Faster setup**: 70-80% time savings vs. sequential phases
- **Specialist expertise**: Right agent for each task
- **Better integration**: Agents work simultaneously on interdependent docs

### Common Parallelization Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Documentation Creation

```
Coordinator spawns in parallel:
- PRD writer (creates PRD.md)
- Technical spec writer (creates TECHNICAL_SPEC.md)
- Architecture writer (creates ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Design writer (creates DESIGN_SYSTEM.md)
```

#### Pattern 2: Agent Generation

```
Coordinator spawns in parallel:
- Core agent creator (coordinator, senior-dev, code-reviewer, test-writer)
- Quality agents (bug-finder, refactor-specialist, qa-tester)
- Infrastructure agents (git-helper, documentation-writer, architecture-advisor)
- Tooling agents (agent-creator, skill-creator)
- Domain agents (project-specific specialists)
```

#### Pattern 3: Command Creation

```
Coordinator spawns in parallel:
- Dev workflow commands (/dev, /commit, /review, /loom-status)
- Testing commands (/test, /plan, /checkpoint)
- Feature commands (/create-feature, /correct-course, /create-story)
- YOLO commands (/yolo, /dev-yolo)
```

#### Pattern 4: Multi-Project Setup

```
Coordinator spawns in parallel:
- Project 1: Full 7-phase setup
- Project 2: Full 7-phase setup
- Project 3: Full 7-phase setup
```

### Best Practices

1. **Launch together**: Spawn all parallel agents at once
2. **Complete context**: Each agent gets full requirements
3. **No dependencies**: Ensure parallel tasks are independent
4. **Coordinator synthesizes**: Results merged by coordinator

---

## üèóÔ∏è Operating Modes

Loom has three distinct entry-point prompts that define its core workflows:

### 1. `setup.md` (New Project Setup)

**Use when**: Setting up Loom in a new (greenfield) or existing (brownfield) project.
**Action**: Run this prompt from within the target project's directory. The AI will autonomously analyze the project, generate all necessary documentation from templates, and synchronize the latest agents and commands from the Loom framework repository.

### 2. `update-setup.md` (Update Existing Setup)

**Use when**: Updating a project that already uses an older version of Loom.
**Action**: Run this prompt from within the target project's directory. The AI will synchronize the core agents/commands, and then intelligently scan and update your project's documentation and story structures to match the latest Loom standards without destroying your content.

### 3. `prepare-setup.md` (Framework Development)

**Use when**: You are a developer modifying the Loom framework itself and need to regenerate the core agent and command files from their source definitions.
**Action**: Run this from the root of the Loom repository. **This is not for user projects.**

---

## üéÆ YOLO Mode: Autonomous Development

Loom projects can run in autonomous mode with configurable breakpoints.

### Stopping Granularities

**A. STORY-LEVEL** (default): Stop at specific breakpoints within each story
**B. EPIC-LEVEL**: Only stop when full epics are completed (maximum autonomy)
**C. CUSTOM**: Select individual breakpoints manually

### Breakpoint Options

```yaml
Story-Level Breakpoints:
1. After development, before code review
2. After code review, before tests
3. After tests, before user testing
4. After user testing, before commit
5. After commit, before push
6. Before any file changes
7. Before running tests
8. Before major refactoring

Epic-Level Breakpoint:
9. After completing epic, before starting next epic
```

### Configuration Examples

**Story-Level Control:**
- `"none"` - Full autonomous mode (prototyping)
- `"1,3,4,8"` - Balanced control (recommended)
- `"all"` - Maximum control (production)

**Epic-Level Control:**
- `"epic"` - Autonomous per epic, stop only at epic boundaries
- Agents complete ALL stories in epic before stopping
- Ideal for high-trust autonomous development

The coordinator agent reads YOLO configuration and automatically handles the complete TDD cycle: Red ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Refactor ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy.

---

## üî¥üü¢ Test-Driven Development (TDD) - MANDATORY

**Projects using Loom MUST enforce strict TDD.**

### The Red-Green-Refactor Cycle

```
1. üî¥ RED: Write failing tests first
   - Write test cases for the feature
   - Run tests ‚Üí They MUST fail (red)
   - If tests pass, you wrote the wrong tests!

2. üü¢ GREEN: Write minimal code to pass
   - Implement just enough code to make tests pass
   - Run tests ‚Üí They MUST pass (green)
   - Don't write extra features

3. üîµ REFACTOR: Clean up the code
   - Improve code quality
   - Remove duplication
   - Better naming, structure
   - Run tests ‚Üí They MUST still pass (green)

4. ‚ôªÔ∏è REPEAT: Iterate until complete
```

### TDD Rules

1. **Write tests BEFORE implementation** - Always. No exceptions.
2. **Write the simplest test first** - Start with happy path
3. **Watch tests fail** - Confirm red state before implementing
4. **Write minimal code** - Only enough to turn tests green
5. **Refactor only when green** - Never refactor on red
6. **One test at a time** - Focus on one test case
7. **Run tests frequently** - After every small change

### Test Coverage Requirements

- **Minimum**: 80% code coverage (MANDATORY)
- **Target**: 90% code coverage
- **Critical paths**: 100% coverage

---

## üö´ Do NOT Section (CRITICAL)

### Never Do

- ‚ùå Skip phases in meta-prompt (even if you think you know what to do)
- ‚ùå Ask unnecessary questions in UPDATE mode
- ‚ùå Copy project-specific docs from template (must regenerate)
- ‚ùå Generate agents without templates (use Loom/prompts/reference/)
- ‚ùå Create partial setups (must be complete)
- ‚ùå Modify agent structure without testing
- ‚ùå Implement code BEFORE writing tests
- ‚ùå Commit code with failing tests
- ‚ùå Commit code with <80% coverage
- ‚ùå Use `any` type in TypeScript (use `unknown` or proper types)
- ‚ùå Skip YOLO mode breakpoints when YOLO mode is OFF
- ‚ùå Refactor when tests are RED (only refactor when GREEN)
- ‚ùå Merge PRs without code review

### Always Do

- ‚úÖ Read INDEX.md BEFORE starting any work
- ‚úÖ Follow meta-prompt phases EXACTLY as specified
- ‚úÖ Read status.xml to understand current feature state
- ‚úÖ Read current story file for acceptance criteria
- ‚úÖ Write tests FIRST (Red-Green-Refactor)
- ‚úÖ Run tests after every change
- ‚úÖ Check coverage (must be ‚â•80%)
- ‚úÖ Use TypeScript strict mode (no `any`)
- ‚úÖ Update documentation when code changes
- ‚úÖ Use conventional commits
- ‚úÖ Update status.xml when work is complete
- ‚úÖ Respect YOLO mode configuration
- ‚úÖ Spawn parallel agents for complex tasks
- ‚úÖ Verify all agents work after generation
- ‚úÖ Create ALL required documentation files
- ‚úÖ Update INDEX.md when new docs added

---

## üìù status.xml Management

### Reading status.xml

**ALL agents MUST read status.xml to understand current feature state.**

**Location**: `docs/development/status.xml`

**What status.xml contains**:

- Current feature (`<current-feature>`)
- Current epic (`<current-epic>`)
- Current story (`<current-story>`)
- Current task (`<current-task>`)
- Completed tasks (`<completed-tasks>`)
- Pending tasks (`<pending-tasks>`)
- What's next (`<whats-next>`)
- Blockers (`<blockers>`)
- YOLO mode configuration (`<yolo-mode>`)
- Last updated timestamp

### Updating status.xml

**When work is complete, update status.xml**:

1. Move completed task from `<current-task>` to `<completed-tasks>`
2. Add commit hash to completed task
3. Move next task from `<whats-next>` to `<current-task>`
4. Update `<whats-next>` with subsequent task
5. Update `<last-updated>` timestamp
6. Add note to `<notes>` if made important decisions

**If epic complete**:

- Update epic status to "completed"
- Set `<current-epic>` to next epic
- Set `<current-story>` to first story of next epic

---

## üöÄ Getting Started with Loom

### To Create a New Project

Run the `setup.md` prompt from within your target project's directory. The AI will analyze your project and guide you through the process.

### To Update an Existing Loom Project

Run the `update-setup.md` prompt from within your project's directory. The AI will sync the latest framework files and update your documentation structure.

---

## üìñ Documentation Reference

- **`setup.md`**: Main entry point for new projects.
- **`update-setup.md`**: Main entry point for updating projects.
- **`prompts/reference/core-agents.md`**: The source of truth for all agent definitions.
- **`prompts/prepare-setup/2-create-commands.md`**: The source of truth for all command definitions.
- **`prompts/templates/doc-templates.md`**: The source of truth for all documentation templates.

---

## üîÑ Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Create Feature in Existing Loom Project

```bash
1. Read status.xml
2. Determine current feature/epic
3. Run: /create-story
4. Run: /plan [story-id]

---

## üö® Known Limitations & Considerations

- **Loom is Claude Code only**: Not compatible with other AI CLIs yet (Gemini, Codex planned)
- **Meta-framework**: Loom scaffolds environments; it doesn't write project code
- **TDD mandatory**: All projects using Loom must enforce strict test-first development
- **Context requirements**: Large projects may exceed token limits (plan accordingly)
- **Phase ordering**: Phases must be followed exactly (no reordering for efficiency)

---

## ü§ù Contributing to Loom

Loom is designed to be extended:

- **Custom Agents**: Use agent-creator to build domain-specific agents
- **Custom Commands**: Add slash commands for project-specific workflows
- **Custom Documentation**: Extend templates for your domain
- **Template Projects**: Create template projects for quick setup

---

## üìû Support & Issues

**For issues or questions about Loom**:

1. Check the relevant meta-prompt (project-setup or project-update)
2. Review phase requirements in prompts/phases/
3. Consult reference documentation in prompts/reference/
4. Check existing project CLAUDEs for examples

---

## üìù Version History

**v1.0** (2025-10-22)
- Initial Loom meta-framework release
- 13 core agents
- 14+ slash commands
- 15+ documentation files
- 3 operating modes (NEW, UPDATE, TEMPLATE)
- YOLO mode with configurable breakpoints
- Strict TDD enforcement

---

## üéì Key Concepts

### Meta-Framework

Loom is a **meta-framework** - a system of prompts, documents, and templates that AI agents use to set up development environments. It's not code you write; it's a framework that orchestrates other agents to build your project.

### Autonomous Agents

Specialized AI agents (coordinator, senior-dev, test-writer, etc.) that execute specific tasks within their domain. Each agent is an expert in its field.

### Test-Driven Development

Strict Red-Green-Refactor cycle where tests are written FIRST, implementation SECOND. This is mandatory in all Loom projects.

### Epic-Based Organization

Features divided into logical epics (usually 2-4 weeks of work), each with multiple stories (2-5 days each). Allows independent development and testing.

### YOLO Mode

Autonomous development loops where agents handle complete TDD cycles (planning, RED, GREEN, REFACTOR, review, test, commit) with configurable stopping points.

### Living Documentation

Documentation that's maintained in parallel with development. docs/status.xml tracks progress, story files track requirements, and INDEX.md ties everything together.

---

**Remember**: Loom treats **agents as the spec executors**. You define requirements; agents maintain context and execute autonomously.

**Ready to build?** Follow the project-setup-meta-prompt and let Loom set up your development environment.
