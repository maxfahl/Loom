# 4: Verification & Commit

**Part of**: `setup.md`

## Purpose

Perform a final verification of all deliverables created during the setup process and create the initial git commit.

## Workflow

1. **Verify Structure**:
   - Confirm that all documentation was generated in the `docs/development` directory.
   - Confirm that the `.claude` directory was created and populated with agents and commands.
   - Confirm that the `docs/development/features` structure and `status.xml` were created.
   - Confirm that `CLAUDE.md` was created.

2. **Initial Commit**:
   - Create a `.gitignore` file appropriate for the project's technology stack.
   - Initialize a git repository if one doesn't exist.
   - Stage all the newly created files.
   - Create a conventional commit message summarizing the setup.

   **Example Commit Message**:

   ```

   - Set up all standard Loom documentation and project structure.
   - Added 46 specialized agents and 18 core commands (+ 5 optional AML commands).
   - Initialized status.xml for feature tracking.
   ```
