**Complete CODE_REVIEW_PRINCIPLES.md Structure**:

```markdown
# Code Review Principles

**Version**: 1.0
**Last Updated**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Framework**: 7-Phase Hierarchical Review

---

## Overview

This document defines the code review methodology for [Project Name]. All code reviews follow a hierarchical 7-phase framework that prioritizes critical architectural and security concerns before moving to optimization and polish.

### Philosophy: "Net Positive > Perfection"

**Merge Criteria**:
- Does this change improve the codebase health overall?
- Are critical issues (Blockers) addressed?
- Is the implementation reasonably maintainable?

**If YES to all three ‚Üí APPROVE**, even if not perfect.

**Why**: Shipping improved code is better than blocking good-enough code. Perfection is the enemy of progress.

---

## Hierarchical Review Framework

All code reviews follow this prioritized checklist:

### 1. Architectural Design & Integrity (Critical)

**Priority**: Critical - Must address before merge if issues found

**Review Checklist**:
- Evaluate if the design aligns with existing architectural patterns and system boundaries
- Assess modularity and adherence to Single Responsibility Principle
- Identify unnecessary complexity - could a simpler solution achieve the same goal?
- Verify the change is atomic (single, cohesive purpose) not bundling unrelated changes
- Check for appropriate abstraction levels and separation of concerns

**Project-Specific References**:
- Review against ARCHITECTURE.md for system design alignment
- Check TECHNICAL_SPEC.md for implementation patterns
- Verify INDEX.md for project context

---

### 2. Functionality & Correctness (Critical)

**Priority**: Critical - Must address before merge if issues found

**Review Checklist**:
- Verify the code correctly implements the intended business logic
- Identify handling of edge cases, error conditions, and unexpected inputs
- Detect potential logical flaws, race conditions, or concurrency issues
- Validate state management and data flow correctness
- Ensure idempotency where appropriate

**Project-Specific References**:
- Verify against PRD.md for requirements compliance
- Check acceptance criteria in current story file

---

### 3. Security (Non-Negotiable)

**Priority**: Blocker - MUST fix before merge

**Review Checklist**:
- Verify all user input is validated, sanitized, and escaped (XSS, SQLi, command injection prevention)
- Confirm authentication and authorization checks on all protected resources
- Check for hardcoded secrets, API keys, or credentials
- Assess data exposure in logs, error messages, or API responses
- Validate CORS, CSP, and other security headers where applicable
- Review cryptographic implementations for standard library usage

**Related Documentation**:
- See SECURITY_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md for OWASP-based security scanning (if available)

---

### 4. Maintainability & Readability (High Priority)

**Priority**: High - Strong recommendation to fix

**Review Checklist**:
- Assess code clarity for future developers
- Evaluate naming conventions for descriptiveness and consistency
- Analyze control flow complexity and nesting depth
- Verify comments explain 'why' (intent/trade-offs) not 'what' (mechanics)
- Check for appropriate error messages that aid debugging
- Identify code duplication that should be refactored

**Engineering Principles**:
- **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself): Eliminate duplication
- **KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Prefer simple solutions
- **YAGNI** (You Aren't Gonna Need It): Don't add unused features

---

### 5. Testing Strategy & Robustness (High Priority)

**Priority**: High - Strong recommendation to fix

**TDD Requirements** (Project-Specific):
- **CRITICAL**: Verify tests were written FIRST (Red-Green-Refactor cycle)
- Check test coverage is ‚â•80% (MANDATORY per project TDD policy from DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md)
- Confirm tests follow project testing conventions
- Validate test file naming and organization matches project structure

**General Testing Review**:
- Evaluate test coverage relative to code complexity and criticality
- Verify tests cover failure modes, security edge cases, and error paths
- Assess test maintainability and clarity
- Check for appropriate test isolation and mock usage
- Identify missing integration or end-to-end tests for critical paths

**Project-Specific References**:
- Check DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md for TDD methodology
- Verify test requirements in current story file

---

### 6. Performance & Scalability (Important)

**Priority**: Important - Recommend fixing if performance-critical

**Review Checklist**:
- **Backend**: Identify N+1 queries, missing indexes, inefficient algorithms
- **Frontend**: Assess bundle size impact, rendering performance, Core Web Vitals
- **API Design**: Evaluate consistency, backwards compatibility, pagination strategy
- Review caching strategies and cache invalidation logic
- Identify potential memory leaks or resource exhaustion

---

### 7. Dependencies & Documentation (Important)

**Priority**: Important - Recommend updating

**Component Library Priority Order** (Project-Specific):

For UI components, verify library priority order from DESIGN_SYSTEM.md:
1. **Kibo UI** (dev tools, specialized components) - CHECK FIRST
2. **Blocks.so** (layouts, dashboard patterns) - CHECK SECOND
3. **ReUI** (animations, motion) - CHECK THIRD
4. **shadcn/ui** (base primitives) - CHECK FOURTH
5. **Custom** (last resort only) - ONLY IF NOTHING EXISTS

**Flag if**: Custom component created when library option exists

**General Dependencies Review**:
- Question necessity of new third-party dependencies
- Assess dependency security, maintenance status, and license compatibility
- Verify API documentation updates for contract changes
- Check for updated configuration or deployment documentation

**Project Documentation References**:
- Review code against INDEX.md for project context
- Check compliance with PRD.md requirements
- Verify technical implementation matches TECHNICAL_SPEC.md
- Confirm UI follows DESIGN_SYSTEM.md guidelines
- Check TDD compliance with DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md

---

## Triage Matrix

All review findings must be categorized using this triage matrix:

### [Blocker]

**Definition**: Must be fixed before merge

**Examples**:
- Security vulnerability (Phase 3)
- Architectural regression (Phase 1)
- TDD non-compliance (tests not written first, <80% coverage) (Phase 5)
- Breaks existing functionality (Phase 2)
- Hardcoded secrets/credentials (Phase 3)

**Action**: Block merge until fixed

---

### [Improvement]

**Definition**: Strong recommendation for improving implementation

**Examples**:
- Unnecessary complexity (Phase 1)
- Missing edge case handling (Phase 2)
- Poor naming conventions (Phase 4)
- Low test coverage on critical path (Phase 5)
- Performance bottleneck (Phase 6)
- Missing documentation (Phase 7)

**Action**: Request changes with explanation

---

### [Nit]

**Definition**: Minor polish, optional

**Examples**:
- Typo in comment
- Inconsistent whitespace
- Suggestion for alternative approach (not clearly better)
- Preference for different code style (already meets standards)

**Action**: Suggest but don't block merge

---

## Communication Principles

When providing code review feedback:

1. **Actionable Feedback**: Provide specific, actionable suggestions with `file:line` references
2. **Explain the "Why"**: When suggesting changes, explain the underlying engineering principle that motivates the suggestion
3. **Apply Triage Matrix**: Categorize significant issues to help the author prioritize
4. **Be Constructive**: Maintain objectivity and assume good intent
5. **Provide Examples**: When possible, show code examples of recommended approach
6. **Link to Standards**: Reference project documentation (ARCHITECTURE.md, DESIGN_SYSTEM.md, etc.)

---

## Review Output Format

Code reviews should follow this structure:

```markdown
## Review Summary

- **Verdict**: [APPROVE | REQUEST_CHANGES | NEEDS_DISCUSSION]
- **Blockers**: X issues
- **Improvements**: Y recommendations
- **Nits**: Z minor suggestions

### 16. SECURITY_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md Template

**Purpose**: OWASP-based security scanning methodology with FALSE_POSITIVE filtering

**When to Create**: Always create for all projects (added in Phase 2: Security Review)

**Source**: OneRedOak security review workflows (`04-REFERENCE-EXTRACTS.md` lines 155-232)

**Complete SECURITY_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md Structure**:

```markdown
# Security Review Checklist

**Version**: 1.0
**Last Updated**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Framework**: OWASP Top 10 with FALSE_POSITIVE Filtering

---

## Overview

This document defines the security review methodology for [Project Name]. All security reviews follow OWASP Top 10 guidelines with battle-tested FALSE_POSITIVE filtering rules from Anthropic.

### 3-Step Analysis Workflow

1. **Step 1**: Identify Vulnerabilities (scan for OWASP Top 10)
2. **Step 2**: Filter False Positives (apply 17 hard exclusions + 12 precedents)
3. **Step 3**: Confidence Scoring (only report findings ‚â•8/10)

### Model Requirement

**CRITICAL**: Security reviews MUST use **Opus model** (claude-opus-4-1) for maximum accuracy.

---

## OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities

### A01: Broken Access Control

**Check for**:
- Missing authentication/authorization checks on protected endpoints
- Insecure direct object references (IDOR) - user can access other users' data
- Privilege escalation opportunities (user can elevate to admin)
- Path traversal vulnerabilities (`../../../etc/passwd`)

**Example Vulnerable Code**:
```typescript
// BAD: No auth check
app.get('/api/user/:id', (req, res) => {
  const user = db.getUser(req.params.id); // Any user can access any ID
  res.json(user);
});

// GOOD: Auth check
app.get('/api/user/:id', authenticate, (req, res) => {
  if (req.user.id !== req.params.id && !req.user.isAdmin) {
    return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Forbidden' });
  }
  const user = db.getUser(req.params.id);
  res.json(user);
});
```

---

### A02: Cryptographic Failures

**Check for**:
- Hardcoded secrets, API keys, or credentials in code
- Weak encryption algorithms (MD5, SHA1, DES - use AES-256, SHA-256+)
- Insecure random number generation (`Math.random()` for security tokens)
- Missing encryption for sensitive data (passwords, PII, tokens)

**Example Vulnerable Code**:
```typescript
// BAD: Hardcoded secret
const API_KEY = "sk-1234567890abcdef";

// GOOD: Environment variable
const API_KEY = process.env.API_KEY;
```

---

### A03: Injection

**Check for**:
- SQL injection (user input in SQL queries without sanitization)
- XSS (user input rendered in HTML without escaping)
- Command injection (user input in shell commands)
- LDAP/XML/NoSQL injection

**Example Vulnerable Code**:
```typescript
// BAD: SQL injection
db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${req.params.id}`);

// GOOD: Parameterized query
db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?', [req.params.id]);
```

---

### A04-A10: [Include remaining OWASP categories]

_(Condense for token efficiency - full template would include all 10 categories)_

---

## FALSE_POSITIVE Filtering Rules

**CRITICAL**: Apply these rules VERBATIM. Battle-tested by Anthropic.

### HARD EXCLUSIONS (17 Rules)

Automatically exclude findings matching these patterns:

1. **Denial of Service (DOS)** - Resource exhaustion attacks
2. **Secrets on disk** - If otherwise secured
3. **Rate limiting** - Service overload scenarios
4. **Memory/CPU exhaustion** - Resource consumption issues
5. **Input validation** - Non-security-critical fields without proven impact
6. **GitHub Actions** - Input sanitization unless clearly exploitable
7. **Lack of hardening** - Best practices vs concrete vulnerabilities
8. **Theoretical race conditions** - Only report if concretely problematic
9. **Outdated libraries** - Managed separately
10. **Memory safety** - Impossible in Rust/memory-safe languages
11. **Unit test files** - Test-only code
12. **Log spoofing** - Unsanitized user input in logs
13. **SSRF path-only** - Only host/protocol control is SSRF
14. **AI prompt injection** - User content in AI prompts
15. **Regex injection** - Untrusted content in regex
16. **Regex DOS** - Regex performance issues
17. **Documentation** - Markdown files
18. **Missing audit logs** - Not a vulnerability

### PRECEDENTS (12 Rules)

Context-specific filtering:

1. **Logging secrets**: High-value secrets in plaintext IS a vuln. URLs are safe
2. **UUIDs**: Unguessable, no validation needed
3. **Env vars/CLI flags**: Trusted in secure environments
4. **Resource leaks**: Memory/file descriptor leaks not valid
5. **Subtle web vulns**: Tabnabbing, XS-Leaks, etc. - only if extremely high confidence
6. **React/Angular XSS**: Secure unless using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
7. **GitHub Actions**: Most not exploitable, require concrete attack path
8. **Client-side auth**: Server handles validation
9. **MEDIUM findings**: Only if obvious and concrete
10. **Jupyter notebooks**: Most not exploitable
11. **Logging non-PII**: Only secrets/passwords/PII are vulns
12. **Shell script injection**: Require concrete attack path

---

## Confidence Scoring (1-10 Scale)

**CRITICAL**: Only report findings with confidence ‚â•8/10

### Scoring Guidelines

- **9-10**: Concrete, exploitable vulnerability. Clear attack path. REPORT.
- **8**: Very likely vulnerability. Specific location. Actionable. REPORT.
- **7**: Probable vulnerability. Needs investigation. DO NOT REPORT.
- **6**: Medium confidence. Needs investigation. DO NOT REPORT.
- **1-5**: Low confidence. Likely false positive. DO NOT REPORT.

### Signal Quality Criteria

For each finding, assess:
1. Is there a concrete, exploitable vulnerability with clear attack path?
2. Does this represent a real security risk vs theoretical best practice?
3. Are there specific code locations and reproduction steps?
4. Would this finding be actionable for a security team?

If NO to any question ‚Üí Reduce confidence score

---

## Severity Classification

### HIGH Severity

**Criteria**:
- Exploitable vulnerability with direct security impact
- Data breach, code execution, or privilege escalation possible
- Immediate remediation required

**Examples**:
- SQL injection on production database
- Hardcoded admin credentials
- Authentication bypass
- Unvalidated file upload leading to code execution

---

### MEDIUM Severity

**Criteria**:
- Security weakness requiring additional conditions to exploit
- Limited impact or requires user interaction
- Should be fixed but not immediately blocking

**Examples**:
- Missing rate limiting on non-critical endpoints
- Weak password requirements
- Lack of CSRF tokens on low-impact forms

---

### LOW Severity

**Criteria**:
- Minor security improvement
- Theoretical concern with unclear attack path
- Optional enhancement

**Examples**:
- Missing security headers on static assets
- Verbose error messages (non-sensitive info)
- Minor information disclosure
