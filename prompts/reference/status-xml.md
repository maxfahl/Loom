# status.xml Structure

**Part of**: [Project Setup Meta Prompt](../project-setup-meta-prompt.md)

## Purpose

Complete XML structure for feature tracking including metadata, epics, current task, completed tasks, pending tasks, blockers, and YOLO mode configuration. This is the file that all agents read to understand current project state.

## Related Files

- [phase-6-features-setup.md](../phases/phase-6-features-setup.md) - Creating status.xml files
- [story-template.md](../templates/story-template.md) - Story structure referenced in status.xml

## Usage

Read this file when:
- Creating features/ directory structure (Phase 6)
- Understanding status.xml format
- Creating /yolo command
- Teaching agents how to read status.xml
- Setting up epic and story tracking

## ðŸ“‹ status.xml File (CRITICAL for Feature Tracking)

### Purpose and Location

#### Purpose

The `status.xml` file tracks the current state of work for each feature directory. All agents and commands MUST read this file to understand:

- What task is currently being worked on
- What has been completed
- What's pending
- Whether YOLO mode is enabled

#### Location

**CRITICAL**: `status.xml` is a **SINGLE FILE** for **ALL FEATURES** located at:

```
docs/development/status.xml
```

**NOT** in individual feature directories. All features share one status.xml file with `<feature>` sections.

```
docs/development/
â””â”€â”€ status.xml              # SINGLE FILE for all features
â””â”€â”€ features/
    â”œâ”€â”€ feature-1/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [documentation only - no status.xml here]
    â””â”€â”€ feature-2/
        â””â”€â”€ [documentation only - no status.xml here]
```

### Reading status.xml (For Agents)

#### How Agents Should Read status.xml

**ALL agents and commands MUST read `docs/development/status.xml` to understand the current state of ALL features.**

**The `status.xml` file contains**: Current task, completed tasks, pending tasks, blockers, YOLO mode, current epic, and current story for every feature.

**For complete `status.xml` usage instructions**: See the `CLAUDE.md` file's "status.xml Management" section, which is created during Phase 5 of the setup.

#### Phase 0 Enhancement: Agent Workflow with Story Files

**Story Status Lifecycle**:

1. **In Progress**: Story is actively being worked on.
2. **Waiting For Review**: All tasks completed, awaiting code review.
3. **Done**: Code review passed, story complete.

**How the `/dev` Command Uses `status.xml`**:

1.  Reads the `<current-story>` value (e.g., "2.1").
2.  Reads the corresponding story file at `docs/development/features/[feature]/epics/[epic]/stories/2.1.md`.
3.  Checks for a "## Review Tasks" section (if it exists, those tasks are prioritized).
4.  Works on tasks and checks them off (`[ ]` â†’ `[x]`).
5.  When ALL tasks are complete, it updates the story's **Status** to "Waiting For Review" and adds a note to `status.xml`.

**How the `/review` Command Uses `status.xml`**:

1.  Reads the `<current-story>` value.
2.  Reads the story file for acceptance criteria.
3.  Reviews the code against the requirements.
4.  **If issues are found**:
    *   Adds or updates the "## Review Tasks" section in the story file.
    *   Adds tasks with priorities: `Fix`, `Improvement`, or `Nit`.
    *   Updates the story's **Status** to "In Progress".
5.  **If no issues are found**:
    *   Updates the story's **Status** to "Done".
    *   Adds a completion note to `status.xml`.

**Review Tasks Format**:

```markdown
## Review Tasks

- [ ] Fix: Blocking issue description (`file:line`)
- [ ] Improvement: High priority improvement (`file:line`)
- [ ] Nit: Low priority polish (`file:line`)
```

### Template for New Features

#### File Creation

During the project setup, the `docs/development/status.xml` file is created and initialized. New `<feature>` blocks are added to this single file as new features are created.

**Template `status.xml` for new features:**

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<feature-status>
  <metadata>
    <feature-name>[Feature Name]</feature-name>
    <last-updated>[ISO 8601 timestamp]</last-updated>

    <!-- Story file location: docs/development/features/[feature-name]/epics/[epic-id]/stories/[epic.story].md -->
