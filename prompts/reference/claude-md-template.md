# CLAUDE.md Template for User Projects

**Purpose**: This is the source template for `CLAUDE.md` files deployed to user projects via the `scripts/deploy-claude-md.sh` script.

**DO NOT modify user project CLAUDE.md files directly‚Äîupdate this template and re-run the deployment script.**

---

## Marker System

The deployment script uses markers to identify which sections to update:

- `<!-- LOOM_FRAMEWORK_START -->` / `<!-- LOOM_FRAMEWORK_END -->` = Framework sections (auto-updated)
- Everything outside markers = User customizations (preserved)

# [PROJECT_NAME] - Claude Code Instructions

**Framework**: Loom AI-Native Development Framework
**Version**: 1.0
**Last Updated**: [YYYY-MM-DD]

<!-- LOOM_FRAMEWORK_START -->

## üßµ What is Loom?

Loom is an **AI-native meta-framework** that provides:
- **16+ specialized AI agents** (coordinator, senior-developer, test-writer, code-reviewer, etc.)
- **16+ slash commands** (/dev, /review, /commit, /yolo, /create-story, etc.)
- **Epic/Story organization** for feature tracking
- **YOLO mode** for autonomous development with configurable breakpoints
- **status.xml** for real-time project state tracking

**Your role**: Execute development tasks using Loom's agents, commands, and documentation structure.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Loom Framework Components

### 1. Specialized Agents (`.claude/agents/`)

**Purpose**: Domain experts that perform specific tasks autonomously.

| Agent | Use For |
|-------|---------|
| **coordinator** | Orchestrate complex multi-phase tasks, spawn parallel sub-agents |
| **senior-developer** | Implement features following architecture and best practices |
| **test-writer** | Write comprehensive tests (TDD Red phase) |
| **code-reviewer** | 7-phase code review with triage matrix |
| **bug-finder** | Identify bugs, edge cases, potential issues |
| **refactor-specialist** | Improve code quality (only when tests GREEN) |
| **qa-tester** | Run tests, validate functionality |
| **git-helper** | Manage git operations, conventional commits |
| **architecture-advisor** | Review system design, SOLID principles |
| **performance-optimizer** | Analyze and optimize performance |
| **documentation-writer** | Update docs, JSDoc, API references |
| **codebase-analyzer** | Analyze brownfield codebases |
| **security-reviewer** | OWASP Top 10 security scanning |
| **design-reviewer** | UI/UX + WCAG 2.1 AA compliance |

**Guardrail**: Each agent has a **single responsibility**. Don't use `code-reviewer` for implementation or `test-writer` for refactoring.

---

### 2. Slash Commands (`.claude/commands/`)

**Purpose**: Streamlined workflows for common operations.

| Command | What It Does | Guardrail |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| `/dev` | Continue development on current story | ONLY works on current story tasks; reads status.xml first |
| `/dev-yolo` | Launch autonomous development loop | Respects YOLO breakpoints; stops when configured |
| `/commit` | Smart commit with tests + linting | ONLY commits if tests pass and coverage ‚â•80% |
| `/review` | Comprehensive code review | ONLY reviews uncommitted changes; creates Review Tasks if issues found |
| `/test` | Run tests with coverage report | Reports coverage; fails if <80% |
| `/loom-status` | Show project status report | Read-only; shows git, tasks, tests |
| `/plan` | Plan feature/task with TDD breakdown | Creates plan docs; doesn't implement |
| `/create-feature` | Create new feature with epics | Scaffolds structure; doesn't implement code |
| `/create-story` | Generate next user story | Creates story file; doesn't implement |
| `/correct-course` | Adjust feature direction | Reorganizes epics; doesn't delete work |
| `/yolo` | Configure YOLO mode breakpoints | Interactive config; doesn't start development |
| `/docs` | Update documentation | ONLY updates docs; doesn't change code |
| `/one-off` | Delegate ad-hoc task to coordinator | For tasks outside story workflow |
| `/fix` | Create high-priority bug fix story | Creates story; doesn't fix immediately |
| `/security-review` | OWASP security scan | Analysis only; creates findings report |
| `/design-review` | UI/UX + accessibility review | Analysis only; creates findings report |

**Guardrail**: Commands are **single-purpose workflows**. They do EXACTLY what their name says‚Äîno more, no less.

---

### 3. Epic/Story Organization

**Structure**:
```
Feature ‚Üí Epic 1, Epic 2, Epic 3
  Epic 1 ‚Üí Story 1.1, 1.2, 1.3
  Epic 2 ‚Üí Story 2.1, 2.2
```

**Rules**:
- **Features** = Major capabilities (2-6 months)
- **Epics** = Logical groupings (2-4 weeks)
- **Stories** = Implementable units (2-5 days)

**Guardrail**: Work on ONE story at a time. Never jump ahead without completing current story.

---

### 4. YOLO Mode (Autonomous Development)

**What it does**: Coordinator agent autonomously completes stories/epics based on configured breakpoints.

**Stopping Granularities**:
- **STORY-LEVEL**: Stop at breakpoints within each story (default)
- **EPIC-LEVEL**: Only stop when full epics complete (maximum autonomy)
- **CUSTOM**: Select individual breakpoints (1-9)

**Guardrail**: ALWAYS respect configured breakpoints. Don't proceed past a breakpoint without user approval.

### üìç File Location Quick Reference

| What You Need | Where To Look |
|---------------|---------------|
| **Current feature/epic/story** | `docs/development/status.xml` (parse `<current-story>`) |
| **Story tasks & acceptance criteria** | `docs/development/features/[feature]/epics/[epic]/stories/[story].md` |
| **All documentation paths** | `docs/development/INDEX.md` |
| **Feature requirements** | `docs/development/features/[feature]/PRD.md` |
| **Technical design** | `docs/development/features/[feature]/TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md` |
| **YOLO breakpoint config** | `docs/development/status.xml` (`<yolo-mode>` tag) |
| **Available agents** | `.claude/agents/*.md` |
| **Available commands** | `.claude/commands/*.md` |
| **Review Tasks** | Current story file (added after `/review` if issues found) |

**Guardrail**: NEVER guess file paths. Read `INDEX.md` or `status.xml` to find exact locations.

## üéØ How to Work in This Project

### Pre-Task Checklist (ALWAYS)

Before starting ANY task, perform these steps in order:

1. **[ ] Read `docs/development/status.xml`**
   - Find current feature: `<current-feature>`
   - Find current epic: `<current-epic>`
   - Find current story: `<current-story>`
   - Find current task: `<current-task>`
   - Check YOLO mode: `<yolo-mode enabled="true/false">`

2. **[ ] Read current story file**
   - Path format: `docs/development/features/[feature]/epics/[epic]/stories/[story].md`
   - Review acceptance criteria
   - Review task list
   - Check for "Review Tasks" section (if exists, prioritize FIRST)

3. **[ ] Read `docs/development/INDEX.md`**
   - Find relevant documentation for this task
   - Understand where to look for additional context

4. **[ ] Determine task complexity**
   - Simple task ‚Üí Use appropriate agent directly
   - Complex task ‚Üí Spawn coordinator agent

5. **[ ] Check TDD requirements**
   - **TDD Level**: [TDD_LEVEL]
   - Write tests BEFORE implementation if required

---

### Task Execution Rules

**Rule 1: Single Responsibility**
- Agents and commands do ONLY what they're designed for
- Don't use `/review` to implement code
- Don't use `/dev` to configure YOLO mode
- Don't use `test-writer` for refactoring

**Rule 2: Respect Boundaries**
- Work on current story ONLY (unless using `/one-off`)
- Don't modify other stories' files
- Don't skip ahead to next epic without completing current

**Rule 3: Update Tracking**
- After completing a task: Update `status.xml`
- After completing story tasks: Check off tasks in story file (`[ ]` ‚Üí `[x]`)
- After all story tasks done: Update story status to "Waiting For Review"

**Rule 4: YOLO Breakpoints**
- ALWAYS check YOLO mode configuration in `status.xml`
- STOP at enabled breakpoints
- Request user approval before proceeding past breakpoint

**Rule 5: Test-First (TDD Level: [TDD_LEVEL])**
- [IF STRICT] **MANDATORY**: Write failing tests (RED) ‚Üí Implement (GREEN) ‚Üí Refactor (BLUE)
- [IF RECOMMENDED] **RECOMMENDED**: Write tests before or alongside implementation
- [IF OPTIONAL] **OPTIONAL**: Add tests for critical functionality
- Never refactor when tests are RED
- Never commit with failing tests

---

### Coordinator Agent Pattern

**When to spawn coordinator**:
- Multi-component features (back-end + front-end)
- Parallel workflows (review existing + implement new)
- Complex tasks requiring orchestration
- YOLO mode autonomous loops

**How to spawn**:
1. Gather ALL context (status.xml, story file, requirements)
2. Spawn coordinator with comprehensive prompt
3. Coordinator spawns parallel sub-agents
4. Coordinator synthesizes results

**Guardrail**: Coordinator MUST receive ALL context. NO information loss during delegation.

---

### Common Workflows

**Workflow 1: Continue Development**
```bash
1. Read status.xml
2. Read current story file
3. Run: /dev
4. Complete tasks (TDD: RED ‚Üí GREEN ‚Üí REFACTOR)
5. Tests pass + coverage ‚â•80%
6. Run: /review
7. If issues ‚Üí Fix Review Tasks ‚Üí Repeat from step 6
8. If no issues ‚Üí Run: /commit
```

**Workflow 2: Start Autonomous Development**
```bash
1. Configure breakpoints: /yolo
2. Launch: /dev-yolo
3. Coordinator autonomously completes stories
4. Stops at configured breakpoints
5. Review work, then resume: /dev-yolo
```

**Workflow 3: Create New Story**
```bash
1. Run: /create-story
2. Story file created with acceptance criteria
3. status.xml updated with new story
4. Run: /dev to start implementation
```

**Workflow 4: Fix Bug Outside Story**
```bash
1. Run: /fix "Description of bug"
2. High-priority fix story created
3. status.xml updated
4. Run: /dev to implement fix
```

## üö´ Critical Guardrails

### NEVER Do

- ‚ùå Skip reading `status.xml` before starting work
- ‚ùå Work on multiple stories simultaneously
- ‚ùå Implement code before writing tests (if TDD STRICT)
- ‚ùå Commit with failing tests
- ‚ùå Commit with coverage <80% (if enforced)
- ‚ùå Proceed past YOLO breakpoints without approval
- ‚ùå Use agents for purposes outside their responsibility
- ‚ùå Modify files outside current feature directory (unless `/one-off`)
- ‚ùå Guess file paths‚Äîread `INDEX.md` or `status.xml`
- ‚ùå Delete Review Tasks‚Äîfix them first

### ALWAYS Do

- ‚úÖ Read `docs/development/INDEX.md` when starting new task
- ‚úÖ Read `docs/development/status.xml` BEFORE every task
- ‚úÖ Read current story file for task details
- ‚úÖ Check for "Review Tasks" section (prioritize FIRST if exists)
- ‚úÖ Update `status.xml` after completing tasks
- ‚úÖ Check off completed tasks in story file (`[ ]` ‚Üí `[x]`)
- ‚úÖ Run tests after every change
- ‚úÖ Respect YOLO mode breakpoint configuration
- ‚úÖ Use coordinator for complex multi-phase tasks
- ‚úÖ Write conventional commit messages
- ‚úÖ Update story status when work complete
