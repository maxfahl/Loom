# CLAUDE.md Template for User Projects

**Purpose**: This is the source template for `CLAUDE.md` files deployed to user projects via the `scripts/deploy-claude-md.sh` script.

**DO NOT modify user project CLAUDE.md files directly‚Äîupdate this template and re-run the deployment script.**

---

## Marker System

The deployment script uses markers to identify which sections to update:

- `<!-- LOOM_FRAMEWORK_START -->` / `<!-- LOOM_FRAMEWORK_END -->` = Framework sections (auto-updated)
- Everything outside markers = User customizations (preserved)

<!-- LOOM_FRAMEWORK_START -->

## üßµ What is Loom?

Loom is an **AI-native meta-framework** that provides:

- **44 specialized AI agents** (coordinator, full-stack-developer, test-automator, code-reviewer, etc.)
- **15 slash commands** (/dev, /review, /commit, /yolo, /create-story, etc.)
- **Epic/Story organization** for feature tracking
- **YOLO mode** for autonomous development with configurable breakpoints
- **status.xml** for real-time project state tracking

**Your role**: Execute development tasks using Loom's agents, commands, and documentation structure.

### 2. Slash Commands (`.claude/commands/`)

**Purpose**: Streamlined workflows for common operations.

| Command            | What It Does                          | Guardrail                                                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/dev`             | Continue development on current story | ONLY works on current story tasks; reads status.xml first              |
| `/commit`          | Smart commit with tests + linting     | ONLY commits if tests pass and coverage ‚â•80%                           |
| `/review`          | Comprehensive code review             | ONLY reviews uncommitted changes; creates Review Tasks if issues found |
| `/test`            | Run tests with coverage report        | Reports coverage; fails if <80%                                        |
| `/loom-status`     | Show project status report            | Read-only; shows git, tasks, tests                                     |
| `/plan`            | Plan feature/task with TDD breakdown  | Creates plan docs; doesn't implement                                   |
| `/create-feature`  | Create new feature with epics         | Scaffolds structure; doesn't implement code                            |

| `/correct-course`  | Adjust feature direction              | Reorganizes epics; doesn't delete work                                 |
| `/yolo`            | Configure YOLO mode breakpoints       | Interactive config; doesn't start development                          |

**Guardrail**: Commands are **single-purpose workflows**. They do EXACTLY what their name says‚Äîno more, no less.

---

### 3. Epic/Story Organization

**Structure**:
```

Feature ‚Üí Epic 1, Epic 2, Epic 3
Epic 1 ‚Üí Story 1.1, 1.2, 1.3
Epic 2 ‚Üí Story 2.1, 2.2

```

**Rules**:
- **Features** = Major capabilities (2-6 months)
- **Epics** = Logical groupings (2-4 weeks)
- **Stories** = Implementable units (2-5 days)

**Guardrail**: Work on ONE story at a time. Never jump ahead without completing current story.

---

### 4. YOLO Mode (Autonomous Development)

**What it does**: Coordinator agent autonomously completes stories/epics based on configured breakpoints.

**Stopping Granularities**:
- **STORY-LEVEL**: Stop at breakpoints within each story (default)
- **EPIC-LEVEL**: Only stop when full epics complete (maximum autonomy)
- **CUSTOM**: Select individual breakpoints (1-9)

**Guardrail**: ALWAYS respect configured breakpoints. Don't proceed past a breakpoint without user approval.

### üìç File Location Quick Reference

| What You Need | Where To Look |
|---------------|---------------|
| **Current feature/epic/story** | `docs/development/status.xml` (parse `<current-story>`) |
| **Story tasks & acceptance criteria** | `docs/development/features/[feature]/epics/[epic]/stories/[story].md` |
| **All documentation paths** | `docs/development/INDEX.md` |
| **Feature requirements** | `docs/development/features/[feature]/PRD.md` |
| **Technical design** | `docs/development/features/[feature]/TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md` |
| **YOLO breakpoint config** | `docs/development/status.xml` (`<yolo-mode>` tag) |
| **Available agents** | `.claude/agents/*.md` |
| **Available commands** | `.claude/commands/*.md` |
| **Review Tasks** | Current story file (added after `/review` if issues found) |

**Guardrail**: NEVER guess file paths. Read `INDEX.md` or `status.xml` to find exact locations.

---

## üéØ How to Work in This Project

### Pre-Task Checklist (ALWAYS)

Before starting ANY task, perform these steps in order:

1. **[ ] Read `docs/development/status.xml`**
   - Find current feature: `<current-feature>`
   - Find current epic: `<current-epic>`
   - Find current story: `<current-story>`
   - Find current task: `<current-task>`
   - Check YOLO mode: `<yolo-mode enabled="true/false">`

2. **[ ] Read current story file**
   - Path format: `docs/development/features/[feature]/epics/[epic]/stories/[story].md`
   - Review acceptance criteria
   - Review task list
   - Check for "Review Tasks" section (if exists, prioritize FIRST)

3. **[ ] Read `docs/development/INDEX.md`**
   - Find relevant documentation for this task
   - Understand where to look for additional context

4. **[ ] Determine task complexity**
   - Simple task ‚Üí Use appropriate agent directly
   - Complex task ‚Üí Spawn coordinator agent

5. **[ ] Check TDD requirements**
   - **TDD Level**: [TDD_LEVEL]
   - Write tests BEFORE implementation if required

---

### Task Execution Rules

**Rule 1: Single Responsibility**
- Agents and commands do ONLY what they're designed for
- Don't use `/review` to implement code
- Don't use `/dev` to configure YOLO mode
- Don't use `test-automator` for refactoring

**Rule 2: Respect Boundaries**
- Work on current story ONLY (unless using `/one-off`)
- Don't modify other stories' files
- Don't skip ahead to next epic without completing current

**Rule 3: Update Tracking**
- After completing a task: Update `status.xml`
- After completing story tasks: Check off tasks in story file (`[ ]` ‚Üí `[x]`)
- After all story tasks done: Update story status to "Waiting For Review"

**Rule 4: YOLO Breakpoints**
- ALWAYS check YOLO mode configuration in `status.xml`
- STOP at enabled breakpoints
- Request user approval before proceeding past breakpoint

**Rule 5: Test-First (TDD Level: [TDD_LEVEL])**
- [IF STRICT] **MANDATORY**: Write failing tests (RED) ‚Üí Implement (GREEN) ‚Üí Refactor (BLUE)
- [IF RECOMMENDED] **RECOMMENDED**: Write tests before or alongside implementation
- [IF OPTIONAL] **OPTIONAL**: Add tests for critical functionality
- Never refactor when tests are RED
- Never commit with failing tests

---

### Coordinator Agent Pattern

**When to spawn coordinator**:
- Multi-component features (back-end + front-end)
- Parallel workflows (review existing + implement new)
- Complex tasks requiring orchestration
- YOLO mode autonomous loops

**How to spawn**:
1. Gather ALL context (status.xml, story file, requirements)
2. Spawn coordinator with comprehensive prompt
3. Coordinator spawns parallel sub-agents
4. Coordinator synthesizes results

**Guardrail**: Coordinator MUST receive ALL context. NO information loss during delegation.

---

### Common Workflows

**Workflow 1: Continue Development**
```bash
1. Read status.xml
2. Read current story file
3. Run: /dev
4. Complete tasks (TDD: RED ‚Üí GREEN ‚Üí REFACTOR)
5. Tests pass + coverage ‚â•80%
6. Run: /review
7. If issues ‚Üí Fix Review Tasks ‚Üí Repeat from step 6
8. If no issues ‚Üí Run: /commit
````

**Workflow 2: Start Autonomous Development**

```bash
1. Configure breakpoints: /yolo
2. Launch: /dev (with YOLO mode configured)
3. Coordinator autonomously completes stories
4. Stops at configured breakpoints
5. Review work, then resume: /dev
```

**Workflow 3: Create New Story**

```bash
1. Run: /create-story
2. Story file created with acceptance criteria
3. status.xml updated with new story
4. Run: /dev to start implementation
```

**Workflow 4: Fix Bug Outside Story**

```bash
1. Run: /fix "Description of bug"
2. High-priority fix story created
3. status.xml updated
4. Run: /dev to implement fix
```
