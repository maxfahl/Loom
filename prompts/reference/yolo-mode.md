# YOLO Mode - Autonomous Development Control

**Version**: 2.0 (Simplified Presets)
**Last Updated**: [Date]

---

## What is YOLO Mode?

YOLO Mode (You Only Live Once) is an autonomous development control system using **simple presets** to determine when agents stop for confirmation versus proceeding automatically.

**Key Concept**: Choose your trust level with agents using 4 intuitive presets instead of configuring individual breakpoints.

---

## 4 Autonomy Presets

### 1. MANUAL - Full Control
**Stop at**: After development ‚Üí Before commit ‚Üí Between stories ‚Üí Between epics
**Use when**:
- Learning Loom
- Critical production features
- First-time setup
- Need to review every major step

### 2. BALANCED - Recommended
**Stop at**: Before commit ‚Üí Between stories
**Use when**:
- Normal development
- Moderate trust in agents
- Want oversight without micromanagement
- Good balance of speed and control

### 3. STORY - Autonomous per Story
**Stop at**: Between stories only
**Use when**:
- Well-defined tasks with clear acceptance criteria
- High trust in agent implementation
- Fast iteration cycles
- Want to review completed stories

### 4. EPIC - Maximum Speed
**Stop at**: Between epics only
**Use when**:
- Trusted, well-documented features
- Maximum autonomy desired
- Overnight development
- Minimal interruptions needed

### 5. CUSTOM - Advanced
**Configure**: Pick individual breakpoints (A, B, C, D)
**Use when**:
- Need fine-grained control
- Power user customization
- Specific workflow requirements

---

## Configuration

### Using the `/yolo` Command (Recommended)

Run `/yolo` to select your preset:

```
Configure YOLO mode - Choose your autonomy level:

1. MANUAL - Full control (stop at every major step)
2. BALANCED - Recommended (stop at code review + commit)
3. STORY - Autonomous per story (only stop between stories)
4. EPIC - Maximum speed (only stop between epics)
5. CUSTOM - Advanced (configure breakpoints manually)

Enter choice (1-5):
```

### Direct Messages

You can also configure YOLO mode by messaging:
- `"Enable BALANCED mode"` - Use recommended preset
- `"Enable EPIC mode"` - Maximum autonomy
- `"Show YOLO status"` - Check current configuration

---

## Breakpoint Reference (Custom Mode)

### Breakpoint A: After Development, Before Code Review
**When**: Feature implementation complete
**What Happens**: Agent presents completed code
**Why Stop**: Review implementation before proceeding
**Example**: "Development complete. Ready for code review?"

### Breakpoint B: After Review, Before Commit
**When**: Code review complete, ready to commit
**What Happens**: Agent ready to commit changes
**Why Stop**: Final review before committing
**Example**: "Code review passed. Ready to commit?"

### Breakpoint C: After Story Complete, Before Next Story
**When**: Current story finished and committed
**What Happens**: Agent ready to move to next story
**Why Stop**: Review completed story before continuing
**Example**: "Story 1.2 complete. Ready to start Story 1.3?"

### Breakpoint D: After Epic Complete, Before Next Epic
**When**: All stories in epic finished
**What Happens**: Agent ready to start next epic
**Why Stop**: Review major milestone before continuing
**Example**: "Epic 1 complete. Ready to start Epic 2?"

## Preset Configurations

| Preset | Breakpoints | Stops | Best For |
|--------|-------------|-------|----------|
| MANUAL | A, B, C, D | 4 per story | Learning, critical code |
| BALANCED | B, C | 2 per story | Normal development |
| STORY | C | 1 per story | High-trust tasks |
| EPIC | D | 1 per epic | Maximum autonomy |
| CUSTOM | User choice | Variable | Power users |

---

## How Agents Use YOLO Mode

**Agents read autonomy configuration from status.xml and respect breakpoints automatically.**

**Key Points**:
- Read `<autonomy-level>` at start of work
- Stop at configured breakpoints only
- Never stop for trivial decisions (naming, comments, formatting)
- Always stop at enabled major workflow transitions
- Continue autonomously between breakpoints

**Example Flow (BALANCED preset)**:
```
Start Story 1.1
‚îú‚îÄ üî¥ RED: Write tests (autonomous)
‚îú‚îÄ üü¢ GREEN: Implement code (autonomous)
‚îú‚îÄ üîµ REFACTOR: Clean code (autonomous)
‚îú‚îÄ ‚úÖ REVIEW: Code review (autonomous)
‚îú‚îÄ ‚è∏Ô∏è STOP at Breakpoint B: "Ready to commit?"
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ User: "yes"
‚îú‚îÄ üìù COMMIT: Create commit (autonomous)
‚îú‚îÄ ‚è∏Ô∏è STOP at Breakpoint C: "Story 1.1 done. Start 1.2?"
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ User: "yes"
‚îî‚îÄ Loop to next story
```

## Best Practices

### DO:
‚úÖ Start with BALANCED preset (recommended)
‚úÖ Use MANUAL for learning Loom workflow
‚úÖ Use EPIC for well-defined, trusted features
‚úÖ Adjust presets based on feature complexity
‚úÖ Review completed stories even in EPIC mode

### DON'T:
‚ùå Use EPIC mode on first try (start with BALANCED)
‚ùå Skip testing because of high autonomy
‚ùå Expect agents to stop for trivial choices
‚ùå Leave CUSTOM mode unless you need it

---

## Troubleshooting

**Agent not stopping when expected?**
- Check `<autonomy-level>` in status.xml
- Run `/yolo` to verify current preset
- Ensure you're using correct preset for your needs

**Agent stopping too often?**
- Switch from MANUAL to BALANCED
- Consider STORY preset for faster iteration
- MANUAL preset stops at every major step

**Want to temporarily skip a breakpoint?**
- When agent stops, say "proceed" or "continue"
- Agent continues to next breakpoint
- Configuration remains unchanged

**Want to change mid-task?**
- Run `/yolo` anytime to switch presets
- Changes apply immediately
- Agent reads status.xml before each breakpoint

---

## File Location

YOLO mode configuration is stored in:
```
docs/development/status.xml
```

**IMPORTANT**: There is only ONE status.xml file for the entire project. It contains configuration for all features.

Example feature section within status.xml:
```xml
<feature name="user-authentication">
  <is-active-feature>true</is-active-feature>
  <autonomy-level>balanced</autonomy-level>
  <breakpoints>
    <after-development>false</after-development>
    <before-commit>true</before-commit>
    <between-stories>true</between-stories>
    <between-epics>false</between-epics>
  </breakpoints>
</feature>
```

The `/yolo` command automatically finds and updates the status.xml file at `docs/development/status.xml`.
