# Update Mode: Validation Workflow

**Part of**: [Project Setup Meta Prompt](../project-setup-meta-prompt.md)

## Purpose

Complete workflow for validating and updating existing setup when status.xml already exists. Includes 6 parallel validation agents, report synthesis, update execution, and verification. Used when meta prompt is run on project that already has setup.

## Related Files

- [../phases/phase-4-commands.md](../phases/phase-4-commands.md) - Commands being validated
- [../templates/doc-templates.md](../templates/doc-templates.md) - Doc templates for validation

## Usage

Read this file:
- When Phase 0 detects status.xml exists
- To validate existing setup matches meta prompt spec
- To identify and fix outdated components
- To add missing agents, commands, or docs

## ‚öôÔ∏è UPDATE MODE: Validate Existing Setup

**This section applies ONLY when status.xml already exists (setup has been run before).**

### Purpose

When this meta prompt is run on a project that already has setup, the goal is to:

1. Validate all setup matches this meta prompt specification
2. Identify missing components (docs, agents, commands)
3. Identify outdated components (old structure, missing MCP knowledge, wrong models)
4. Update everything to match current meta prompt specification
5. Add any new features from this meta prompt version

**Important**: Do NOT ask discovery questions - the project already has setup. Read existing files to understand project context.

---

### Update Mode Process (6 Phases)

#### Phase 0: Read Existing Setup

**BEFORE spawning validation agents, gather context**:

1. **Read status.xml** (SINGLE FILE for all features):

   ```bash
   # status.xml is at docs/development/status.xml
   # Find active feature within this single file
   grep "<is-active-feature>true</is-active-feature>" docs/development/status.xml
   ```

2. **Read INDEX.md**: `docs/development/INDEX.md`
   - Understand existing documentation structure
   - Identify what docs exist

3. **Read CLAUDE.md** (if exists): Root directory
   - Understand project type, tech stack, TDD enforcement
   - Extract project context

4. **List existing agents**:

   ```bash
   ls -la .claude/agents/
   ```

5. **List existing commands**:

   ```bash
   ls -la .claude/commands/
   ```

6. **Identify project type**: Look for indicators in CLAUDE.md, PRD.md, or status.xml

**After gathering context, proceed to Phase 1.**

---

#### Phase 1: Spawn Validation Agents (6 Parallel Agents)

**Launch 6 specialized validation agents simultaneously to check different aspects of setup:**

### Authoritative Sources (READ THESE FIRST)

Before validating, each validator MUST read these authoritative references:

**For Agents**:
- `prompts/reference/core-agents.md` - Lists all 13 required core agents by name
- Extract agent names into a mechanical checklist

**For Commands**:
- `prompts/phases/phase-4-commands.md` - Lists all 12+ required commands by name
- Extract command names into a mechanical checklist (lines 17-32)

**For Features**:
- `prompts/phases/phase-6-features-setup.md` - Specifies exact folder structure
- `prompts/reference/status-xml.md` - Specifies status.xml structure

**For Documentation**:
- `prompts/templates/doc-templates.md` - Lists all 12+ required documentation files

This prevents validators from guessing or estimating. Everything is explicit.

**Agent 1: Documentation Validator**

```markdown
Task: Validate all documentation against meta prompt specification

**Context**:

- Project type: [from CLAUDE.md]
- Tech stack: [from CLAUDE.md/PRD.md]
- TDD enforcement: [from CLAUDE.md]

**Your mission**:

1. Read meta prompt sections on required documentation (12+ files)
2. Check which docs exist in `docs/development/`
3. For each existing doc:
   - Verify structure matches meta prompt templates
   - Check for missing sections
   - Verify TDD language matches enforcement level
4. List missing docs
5. List docs needing updates

**Content Validation (NEW - CRITICAL)**:

Beyond structure, verify ACTUAL OneRedOak enhancements are present:

6. **Check CODE_REVIEW_PRINCIPLES.md** (if exists):
   - Contains 7-phase hierarchical framework?
   - Contains "Net Positive > Perfection" philosophy?
   - Contains triage matrix (Blocker/Improvement/Nit)?
   - Contains SOLID/DRY/KISS/YAGNI principles?

7. **Check SECURITY_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md** (if exists):
   - Contains OWASP Top 10 methodology?
   - Contains FALSE_POSITIVE filtering rules (17 hard exclusions + 12 precedents)?
   - Contains 3-step analysis workflow?
   - Contains confidence scoring (8/10+ threshold)?

8. **Check DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md** (if exists):
   - Contains 7-phase design methodology?
   - Contains Playwright MCP integration guide?
   - Contains WCAG 2.1 AA checklist?
   - Contains S-Tier SaaS checklist?

9. **Check story-template.md** (if exists):
   - Contains status values: "In Progress" | "Waiting For Review" | "Done"?
   - Contains "Review Tasks" section template?
   - Contains task format with priority (Fix/Improvement/Nit)?

**Deliverable**: Markdown report with:

- ‚úÖ Docs that are complete and correct
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Docs that exist but need updates (what's missing/wrong)
- ‚ùå Docs that are missing entirely (include 3 new OneRedOak docs)
- üî¥ CRITICAL: Missing OneRedOak enhancements (7-phase, FALSE_POSITIVE, status workflow)
- üìã Detailed update instructions for each doc needing changes
```

---

#### Phase 3.5: Hard Verification Checkpoints (BLOCKING)

**CRITICAL: Run these verification commands BEFORE proceeding to Phase 4**

**These are HARD STOPS. If ANY check fails, validation must abort.**

**Checkpoint 1: Agent Count Verification**

```bash
# Count agents (should be 13+ for core agents)
agent_count=$(ls -1 .claude/agents/*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
echo "Agent count: $agent_count (expected: 13+)"

if [ "$agent_count" -lt 13 ]; then
  echo "ABORT: Only $agent_count agents found, need 13+"
  exit 1
fi
```

**Checkpoint 2: Critical Agent Existence**

```bash
# Verify critical agents exist
critical_agents=("coordinator" "code-reviewer" "security-reviewer" "design-reviewer")

for agent in "${critical_agents[@]}"; do
  if [ ! -f ".claude/agents/${agent}.md" ]; then
    echo "ABORT: Critical agent missing: ${agent}"
    exit 1
  fi
done

echo "All critical agents exist"
```

**Checkpoint 3: Command Count Verification**

```bash
# Count commands (should be 12+ for core commands)
command_count=$(ls -1 .claude/commands/*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
echo "Command count: $command_count (expected: 12+)"

if [ "$command_count" -lt 12 ]; then
  echo "ABORT: Only $command_count commands found, need 12+"
  exit 1
fi
```

**Checkpoint 4: Critical Command Existence**

```bash
# Verify critical commands exist
critical_commands=("dev" "dev-yolo" "review" "security-review" "design-review")

for cmd in "${critical_commands[@]}"; do
  if [ ! -f ".claude/commands/${cmd}.md" ]; then
    echo "ABORT: Critical command missing: /${cmd}"
    exit 1
  fi
done

echo "All critical commands exist"
```

**Checkpoint 5: Feature Structure Verification**

```bash
# Check for stories at old locations (MUST be empty)
old_stories_count=$(find docs/stories -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')

if [ "$old_stories_count" -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "ABORT: Found $old_stories_count stories at OLD location docs/stories/"
  echo "Migration required to docs/development/features/.../epics/.../stories/"
  exit 1
fi

echo "No stories at old location (good)"
```

**Checkpoint 6: /dev-yolo Specific Check**

```bash
# Verify /dev-yolo is SEPARATE from /yolo
if [ ! -f ".claude/commands/dev-yolo.md" ]; then
  echo "ABORT: /dev-yolo command is MISSING"
  echo "This is SEPARATE from /yolo (which is for configuration)"
  exit 1
fi

if [ ! -f ".claude/commands/yolo.md" ]; then
  echo "WARNING: /yolo command is missing (should exist for configuration)"
fi

echo "/dev-yolo command exists (correct)"
```

**IF ANY CHECKPOINT FAILS**:
1. STOP validation immediately
2. Report which checkpoint failed
3. Return to Phase 3 to fix the issue
4. DO NOT proceed to Phase 4 until ALL checkpoints pass

**ALL CHECKPOINTS PASSED?** ‚úÖ Proceed to Phase 4

---

#### Phase 4: Verification

**After update agents complete, verify changes**:

1. **Re-run validation** (spawn same 6 validation agents)
2. **Compare before/after** reports
3. **Verify all critical issues resolved**
4. **Check for regressions**

**Present verification report to user**:

```markdown
## ‚úÖ Update Verification Report

### Before Update

- Documentation: X/12+ complete
- Agents: Y/12+ complete
- Commands: Z/11+ complete
- Overall Grade: C

### After Update

- Documentation: 12/12+ complete ‚úÖ
- Agents: 12/12+ complete ‚úÖ
- Commands: 11/11+ complete ‚úÖ
- Overall Grade: A ‚úÖ

### Changes Made

- Created: [list new files]
- Updated: [list updated files]
- Removed: [list removed files]

### Remaining Issues (if any)

- [List any remaining issues]
```

---

#### Phase 5: Git Commit (Optional)

**Ask user**: "Would you like to commit these setup updates?"

**If yes**:

1. Stage all changes
2. Create conventional commit:

   ```
   chore(setup): update project setup to match meta prompt v1.0

   - Add missing documentation: [list]
   - Update agents with MCP server knowledge: [list]
   - Add missing commands: [list]
   - Migrate feature structure to epic/story system
   - Update CLAUDE.md with new sections

   All setup now matches meta prompt specification.
   ```

---

#### Phase 6: User Handoff

**Provide user with summary**:

```markdown
## üéâ Setup Update Complete

Your project setup has been validated and updated to match the latest meta prompt specification.

### What Changed

- [Summary of changes]

### What's New

- [New features from this meta prompt version]

### Next Steps

1. Review updated documentation in `docs/development/`
2. Review updated agents in `.claude/agents/`
3. Review updated commands in `.claude/commands/`
4. Run `/status` to see current project state
5. Continue development with `/dev` command

### Need Help?

- Run `/help` for command reference
- Read `docs/development/START_HERE.md` for project overview
- Check `CLAUDE.md` for complete AI assistant instructions
```

---

### Update Mode: Key Principles

**1. Preserve User Content**

- NEVER delete user-created content without explicit permission
- ONLY add missing sections or update structure
- Preserve custom agents/commands (append to standard set)

**2. Follow Meta Prompt Exactly**

- Every update MUST match current meta prompt specification
- If meta prompt says "13 agents", ensure 12 agents exist
- If meta prompt says "MCP knowledge for code-reviewer", add it

**3. Parallel Execution**

- Use 6 parallel validation agents
- Use 4 parallel update agents
- Maximize efficiency while preventing conflicts

**4. Verification Required**

- Always re-validate after updates
- Always show before/after comparison
- Always get user approval before committing

**5. Graceful Migration**

- If old structure exists (e.g., tasks without epics), migrate gracefully
- Create migration plan before executing
- Preserve existing task/story content during migration
