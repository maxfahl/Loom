# Update Mode: Validation Workflow

**Part of**: [Project Setup Meta Prompt](../project-setup-meta-prompt.md)

## Purpose

Complete workflow for validating and updating existing setup when status.xml already exists. Includes 6 parallel validation agents, report synthesis, update execution, and verification. Used when meta prompt is run on project that already has setup.

## ‚öôÔ∏è UPDATE MODE: Validate Existing Setup

**This section applies ONLY when status.xml already exists (setup has been run before).**

### Purpose

When this meta prompt is run on a project that already has setup, the goal is to:

1. Validate all setup matches this meta prompt specification
2. Identify missing components (docs, agents, commands)
3. Identify outdated components (old structure, missing MCP knowledge, wrong models)
4. Update everything to match current meta prompt specification
5. Add any new features from this meta prompt version

**Important**: Do NOT ask discovery questions - the project already has setup. Read existing files to understand project context.

---

### Update Mode Process (6 Phases)

#### Phase 0: Read Existing Setup

**BEFORE spawning validation agents, gather context**:

1. **Read status.xml** from active feature:

   ```bash
   # Find active feature
   grep -r "<is-active-feature>true</is-active-feature>" features/*/status.xml
   ```

2. **Read INDEX.md**: `docs/development/INDEX.md`
   - Understand existing documentation structure
   - Identify what docs exist

3. **Read CLAUDE.md** (if exists): Root directory
   - Understand project type, tech stack, TDD enforcement
   - Extract project context

4. **List existing agents**:

   ```bash
   ls -la .claude/agents/
   ```

5. **List existing commands**:

   ```bash
   ls -la .claude/commands/
   ```

6. **Identify project type**: Look for indicators in CLAUDE.md, PRD.md, or status.xml

**After gathering context, proceed to Phase 1.**

---

#### Phase 1: Spawn Validation Agents (6 Parallel Agents)

**Launch 6 specialized validation agents simultaneously to check different aspects of setup:**

#### Phase 2: Collect Validation Reports

**Wait for all 6 validation agents to complete.**

**Synthesize findings**:

1. Combine all 6 reports
2. Categorize issues by severity:
   - üî¥ CRITICAL: Missing core components (status.xml structure, core docs, core agents)
   - üü° HIGH: Outdated components (missing MCP knowledge, wrong models, old templates)
   - üü¢ MEDIUM: Missing optional components (tech-specific agents, custom commands)
   - üîµ LOW: Minor inconsistencies (formatting, typos)

3. Create prioritized update plan:
   - Phase A: Fix critical issues
   - Phase B: Update high-priority components
   - Phase C: Add missing optional components
   - Phase D: Fix minor inconsistencies

**Present summary to user**:

**After user approval, spawn update agents in parallel:**

**Update Strategy: 4 Parallel Update Agents**

**Agent 1: Documentation Updater**

- Input: Documentation validation report
- Task: Create/update all docs to match meta prompt
- Process:
  1. For missing docs: Create from templates

  4. Preserve existing content, only add/update as needed

**Agent 2: Agent Updater**

- Input: Agent validation report
- Task: Create/update all agents to match meta prompt
- Process:
  1. For missing agents: Create from meta prompt spec
  2. For outdated agents: Add MCP knowledge, update templates, fix YAML
  3. Remove deprecated agents
  4. Ensure all agents have INDEX.md + status.xml reading template
  5. Add MCP server integration sections where applicable

**Agent 3: Command Updater**

- Input: Command validation report
- Task: Create/update all commands to match meta prompt
- Process:
  1. For missing commands: Create from meta prompt spec
  2. For outdated commands: Update process descriptions, fix YAML
  3. Ensure /create-story command exists

  2. Update CLAUDE.md with any new sections
  3. Fix folder structure issues

---

#### Phase 4: Verification

**After update agents complete, verify changes**:

1. **Re-run validation** (spawn same 6 validation agents)
2. **Compare before/after** reports
3. **Verify all critical issues resolved**
4. **Check for regressions**

**Present verification report to user**:

```markdown
## ‚úÖ Update Verification Report

### Before Update

- Documentation: X/12+ complete
- Agents: Y/12+ complete
- Commands: Z/11+ complete
- Overall Grade: C

### After Update

- Documentation: 12/12+ complete ‚úÖ
- Agents: 12/12+ complete ‚úÖ
- Commands: 11/11+ complete ‚úÖ
- Overall Grade: A ‚úÖ

### Changes Made

- Created: [list new files]
- Updated: [list updated files]
- Removed: [list removed files]

### Remaining Issues (if any)

- [List any remaining issues]
```

---

#### Phase 5: Git Commit (Optional)

**Ask user**: "Would you like to commit these setup updates?"

**If yes**:

1. Stage all changes
2. Create conventional commit:

   ```
   chore(setup): update project setup to match meta prompt v1.0

   - Add missing documentation: [list]
   - Update agents with MCP server knowledge: [list]
   - Add missing commands: [list]
   - Migrate feature structure to epic/story system
   - Update CLAUDE.md with new sections

   All setup now matches meta prompt specification.
   ```

---

#### Phase 6: User Handoff

**Provide user with summary**:

```markdown
## üéâ Setup Update Complete

Your project setup has been validated and updated to match the latest meta prompt specification.

### What Changed

- [Summary of changes]

### What's New

- [New features from this meta prompt version]

### Next Steps

1. Review updated documentation in `docs/development/`
2. Review updated agents in `.claude/agents/`
3. Review updated commands in `.claude/commands/`
4. Run `/status` to see current project state
5. Continue development with `/dev` command

### Need Help?

- Run `/help` for command reference
- Read `docs/development/START_HERE.md` for project overview
- Check `CLAUDE.md` for complete AI assistant instructions
```

### Update Mode: Key Principles

**1. Preserve User Content**

- NEVER delete user-created content without explicit permission
- ONLY add missing sections or update structure
- Preserve custom agents/commands (append to standard set)

**2. Follow Meta Prompt Exactly**

- Every update MUST match current meta prompt specification
- If meta prompt says "13 agents", ensure 12 agents exist
- If meta prompt says "MCP knowledge for code-reviewer", add it

**3. Parallel Execution**

- Use 6 parallel validation agents
- Use 4 parallel update agents
- Maximize efficiency while preventing conflicts

**4. Verification Required**

- Always re-validate after updates
- Always show before/after comparison
- Always get user approval before committing

**5. Graceful Migration**

- If old structure exists (e.g., tasks without epics), migrate gracefully
- Create migration plan before executing
- Preserve existing task/story content during migration
