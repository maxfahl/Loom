# Phase 5: CLAUDE.md Creation

**Part of**: [Project Setup Meta Prompt](../project-setup-meta-prompt.md)

## Purpose

Create comprehensive CLAUDE.md file with all sections including Skills usage, parallel agent strategy, coordinator pattern, agents reference, commands reference, model reference, documentation structure, tech stack, project structure, methodology, code style, do/don't section, and pre-task checklist.

## Related Files

- [../reference/core-agents.md](../reference/core-agents.md) - Agents to document
- [phase-4-commands.md](phase-4-commands.md) - Commands to document
- [phase-6-features-setup.md](phase-6-features-setup.md) - Next phase

## Usage

Read this file:
- In Phase 5 after commands are created
- To understand complete CLAUDE.md structure
- For all 16 sections that must be included
- For brownfield CLAUDE.md merging strategy

## üìÑ CLAUDE.md Structure

**Purpose**: AI assistant instructions for the project

**Critical Sections** (in order):

### 1. Header

```markdown
# [Project Name] - AI Assistant Instructions

**Version**: 1.0
**Last Updated**: [Date]
**Project Status**: [Planning/Development/Production]
```

### 2. Internal Checklist (CRITICAL)

```markdown
## ‚úÖ Internal Checklist for Claude Code

**Before starting any task, create an internal checklist based on the task:**

### Pre-Task Preparation

- [ ] Read INDEX.md (`docs/development/INDEX.md`) for project context
- [ ] Read status.xml for active feature (`features/[feature]/status.xml`)
- [ ] Identify which feature is currently active (`<is-active-feature>true</is-active-feature>`)
- [ ] Check current epic (`<current-epic>`)
- [ ] Check current story (`<current-story>`)
- [ ] Read current story file if exists (`docs/[feature-name]/stories/[epic.story].md`)
- [ ] Review story acceptance criteria, tasks, and subtasks
- [ ] Check YOLO mode configuration (`<yolo-mode enabled="true/false">`)
- [ ] Understand current task (`<current-task>`)
- [ ] Review what's been completed (`<completed-tasks>`)
- [ ] Know what's next (`<whats-next>`)

### Task Execution Decision

- [ ] Determine if task is complex enough to require coordinator agent
- [ ] If coordinator needed: Spawn coordinator with complete context
- [ ] If simple task: Proceed directly with appropriate agent(s)

### During Execution

- [ ] Respect YOLO mode breakpoints (stop at enabled breakpoints)
- [ ] Spawn parallel sub-agents when possible (back-end + front-end, review + implement, etc.)
- [ ] Ensure no information loss when delegating to sub-agents
- [ ] Follow TDD methodology ([STRICT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL] based on project)

### After Completion

- [ ] Update status.xml (move completed task, update current, update whats-next)
- [ ] Add commit hash to completed task
- [ ] Update last-updated timestamp
- [ ] Mark epic as completed if all epic tasks done
```

### 3. Claude Skills Emphasis

```markdown
## üéØ CRITICAL: Use Claude Skills

**ALWAYS utilize Claude Skills when available for maximum efficiency.**

- Check available Skills before building custom solutions
- Skills optimize context usage and execution speed
```

### 4. Parallel Agent Strategy

```markdown
## ‚ö° Parallel Agent Execution Strategy (CRITICAL)

**ALWAYS utilize multiple agents in parallel whenever possible.**

[Example workflows]
[How to launch parallel agents]
[Best practices]
```

### 5. Coordinator Agent Pattern

```markdown
## üéØ Coordinator Agent Pattern (CRITICAL)

**All complex user requests must flow through the coordinator agent.**

### Standard Workflow:

1. User sends request
2. Claude Code clarifies requirements (if needed)
3. Claude Code gathers context (INDEX.md, status.xml, docs)
4. Claude Code spawns coordinator agent with comprehensive prompt
5. Coordinator spawns parallel sub-agents for each work stream
6. Coordinator synthesizes results

### When to Use:

- Multi-component features (back-end + front-end)
- Parallel workflows (review existing + implement new)
- Complex tasks needing orchestration

### Example:

"Implement user auth" ‚Üí Coordinator spawns:

- senior-developer-backend (in parallel)
- senior-developer-frontend (in parallel)
- test-writer (in parallel)
- documentation-writer (in parallel)

**CRITICAL**: Coordinator must pass ALL context to sub-agents. No information loss.
```

### 6. Slash Commands Reference

```markdown
## üéØ Custom Slash Commands

| Command | Model | Description |
| ------- | ----- | ----------- |

[Table of all commands]

### 9. Documentation Structure

```markdown
## üìö Documentation Structure

**ALWAYS consult the Master Index first**: `docs/development/INDEX.md`

[Quick reference table]
```

### 10. Tech Stack

### 12. Development Methodology

```markdown
## [Methodology Icon] [Methodology Name]

[If TDD: Red-Green-Refactor explanation]
[Rules and requirements]
[Coverage targets]

**IMPORTANT**: Language varies based on TDD enforcement level:

**Fully Enforced TDD**:

- "**THIS PROJECT FOLLOWS STRICT TDD. NO EXCEPTIONS.**"
- "Write tests BEFORE implementation"
- "Tests MUST pass before committing"
- "MANDATORY: 80% coverage minimum"
- Use "MUST", "REQUIRED", "ALWAYS", "NEVER"

**Recommended TDD**:

- "This project follows Test-Driven Development best practices"
- "Tests should be written before or alongside implementation"
- "Tests are strongly recommended before committing"
- "Target: 80% coverage"
- Use "SHOULD", "RECOMMENDED", "PREFER", "AVOID"

**No TDD**:

- "Tests should be added for critical functionality"
- "Test coverage is measured but not strictly enforced"
```

### 13. Code Style & Conventions

```markdown
## üéØ Code Style & Conventions
